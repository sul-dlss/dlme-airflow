          "Ẓuhūr al-amān (The advent of security) is a book on civics published during the reign of Ammanullah Khan (1919-29) as amir of Afghanistan. The book's title pays homage to the name of Ammanullah Khan himself. In its treatment of the duties of the members of Afghan society to the ruler and to each other, Ẓuhūr al-amān appears to highlight the challenges faced by Ammanullah Khan in his efforts to modernize Afghanistan. The book is divided into more than 30 short chapters describing the rights and responsibilities of the ruler, of persons living within a family unit, and of members of Afghan society as a whole. Some sections, such as one on the rights that are to be afforded to the king (ḥuquq-i lazima bar padishah), are further divided into subsections. The book begins with several chapters on religious matters, including those on tauhid (the unity of God), on ʻibada (worship), and on fahm-i sharīʻat-i rasūl ʻalayhi al-salām (the sharia). Ẓuhūr al-amān was published on October 11, 1923, by the then newly established Ministry of Education. The author of the work, a religious scholar by the name of ʻAbd al-Haqq, lists his father as ʻAbd al-ʻAziz from the village of Lower Arghanda in the township of Paghman, near Kabul.  He highlights, as well, his tribal affiliation with the well-known Pushtun tribe of Suleimankhel. World Digital Library."

          "Commentary and explanation of some Qurʼānic verses. Kashf al-asrār (The unveiling of mysteries) is a book of Qur'anic commentary dating from the early 20th century. The author, Shir Ahmad, was from Kabul, Afghanistan. In the Kashf al-asrār, Shir Ahmad makes repeated reference to an earlier and more comprehensive commentary but states that, because of the great bulk of the earlier work, he was forced to write a short text dealing with various essential topics. The Kashf al-asrār is organized as an introduction and 13 sections, with each section treating a collection of related verses from the Qur'an. Shir Ahmad writes the introduction in Persian, in which he makes a customary plea about the potential shortcomings of his work. In the subsequent section the commentary is in Arabic. The Qur'anic verses under consideration are written in the same color and in the same naskh calligraphy as the commentary, but they are set off by use of a larger script size. Somewhat unexpectedly, Shir Ahmad switches back to a Persian commentary (written in the nasta'liq calligraphic style) mid-way through the subsequent section. The work concludes with a table of contents. Shir Ahmad's Kashf al-asrār shares its name with a number of works, including a celebrated 12th century Qur'anic commentary by Rashid al-Din Maybudi. The book was printed and published in 1910 or 1911 in Kabul by Matbaʻah-i ʻUmumi. World Digital Library."

          "On recitation and reading of the Qurʼān. This work is an introduction to the rules of pronunciation during the recitation of the Qur'an. It was written for students at the elementary and intermediate levels in Afghanistan. In the preface the author states that in teaching the rules of proper pronunciation, the focus should be on skills that young Persian- or Pushto-speaking students have not been exposed to, e.g., the proper pronunciation of letters in Arabic, mudd (prolongation), awqaf (pause), and other topics. The book begins with a list of makharij (emission points) for the letters. These are listed as 17 locations in the throat, tongue, lips, nose, and mouth. The conventions for sounding the letters are divided into various categories. For the letter nun (n) the following cases are listed: izhar (clarity, i.e., the clear pronunciation of the letter if it is following by \"letters of the throat\" such as the ʻayin); idgham (merging, i.e., of two consecutive words, when the first word ends in a nun, and the second word is followed by ra', r, or lam, l); iqlab (conversion, i.e., the conversion of the nun to a mim, m, if it is followed by a ba', b); and ikhfa' (concealment, which covers the remaining cases for the letter nun, and is accompanied by a ghunnah, or nasalization). A previous owner has added occasional corrections to the text. The work was published in the year 1300 AH of the solar Islamic calendar, corresponding to 1921 or 1922. This anonymously written work was printed at the Ministry of Education Press in Kabul, under the auspices of Muhammad Sulayman Khan, who served as minister of education under Amanullah Khan (reigned 1919-29).

          "Risālah-i Puṣhto It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr (On the obedience of the ruler in Pashto) is a tract meant to encourage obedience to the ruler of Afghanistan. The expression ūlā al-amr refers to one who is foremost in authority, and the title of the book references a Qur'anic verse (5:59), \"Oh Believers! Obey the Lord and the Prophet and those who are foremost in authority amongst you,\" which is quoted at the beginning of the work. Numerous quotes from the hadith literature (primarily from the collection of al-Bukhari) follow. The Arabic text of each hadith is followed by an explanation in Pashto, several of which equate disobedience with jahāla (ignorance, i.e. of religious precepts) and contrast it with shahāda (bearing testimony or witness to Islam). The aim of the work is thus plainly the garnering of legitimacy and authority for the then-ruling Afghan emir, Habibullah Khan (reigned 1901-19). The Persian original of this work was composed by Maulawi ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan (1878 or 1879-1919), who, ironically, appears to have been jailed for his involvement in the constitutional movement in the early 1900s against the authoritarianism of Habibullah Khan. By the time he composed the It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr, ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan was serving Habibullah Khan in the role of mullā-i darbār (court theologian). Both ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan and the translator, Salih Muhammad, were teachers at the Habibiya School founded by Habibullah Khan. The Pashto translation of It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr was printed by the Dar al-Saltanah press in Kabul. The cover states that it is the first Pashto work printed in Afghanistan, and that it was meant to be distributed free of charge. World Digital Library."

          "Tuḥfat al-ʻulamā' (An offering for religious scholars) is ostensibly a tract addressed to the ʻulamā' (religious scholars) of Afghanistan, asking them to actively discourage the suspicion held by their followers toward things foreign. It was written by order of the Afghan ruler Sher Ali Khan (reigned 1863-66 and 1868-79). Little is known of the author, ʻAbd al-Qadir Khan, although he is identified as a qāḍī (judge) indicating his religious authority. ʻAbd al-Qadir uses numerous quotations from the hadith literature to argue that practices originating with \"non-believers\" may be in accordance with the sharia provided these practices benefit the Islamic ummah (community). The foreign practices in question mostly have to do with the military--that military spending and a strong military are consistent with Islamic teachings remain major themes throughout the work. Although the heavy reliance on the Qur'an, the hadith, and quotations by learned men in the Islamic tradition (such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Muhammad al-Ghazali) demonstrate the expertise and the erudition of the author (or, possibly, authors), the polemical and often repetitious arguments serve to emphasize the purely propagandistic aspects of Tuḥfat al-ʻulamā'. The timing of the publication is noteworthy. For much of his career Sher Ali Khan was in the enviable position of managing the conflicting interests of tsarist Russia and Great Britain, two colonial powers locked in the \"Great Game\" for mastery over Afghanistan. The publication of Tuḥfat al-ʻulamā' in 1875 predates the Second Anglo-Afghan War (and Sher Ali's retreat from Kabul) by several years. The book was published in the Mustafawi printing press, which was founded by Sher Ali Khan, and is one of the earliest works printed in Afghanistan. World Digital Library."

          "Written in India by an unknown author in the final decades of the 19th century, Ghāyat al-shuʻūr bi-ḥujaj al-ḥajj al-mabrūr (The utmost knowledge of the arguments for the blessed Hajj) describes the various observances associated with the Hajj pilgrimage. The introduction and the text are written in Arabic, but the main text is in Persian, as are two appended texts (by a different author), a taqriz (encomium) praising Ghāyat al-shuʻūr, and a shorter versified text directed against critics of the work. The main text is dedicated by the author to a nobleman by the name of Rahim al-Din. The afterword states that the work is a second edition, printed in 1290 AH (1873) by the famed Newal Kishore Press in Lucknow, the first edition having been printed in Calcutta in 1283 AH (1866-67). Inserted prior to the discussion of the publication date is a chronogram that stands for 1290 AH, i.e., the date of the second edition of the work. The chronogram is credited to a Sayyid Munawwar Husayn, an employee of the court of Awadh (also called Oudh). The nawabs of Awadh were a Persian Shiʻa dynasty that had migrated to India from Nishapur (in present-day Iran) and that actively promulgated Persian letters and Shiʻa beliefs. The Nawabate of Awadh was stripped of power, however, by the British in the aftermath of the Uprising of 1857 (also known as the Sepoy Rebellion), roughly a decade before Ghāyat al-shuʻūr was first published. The mention of the court of Awadh is therefore somewhat anachronistic--a reference to what was by then at best a ceremonial office. World Digital Library."

          "This manuscript in Persian is an untitled Sufi text on meditation containing both poetry and prose. It was completed in early 1520, probably in Herat (present-day Afghanistan) or Mashhad (present-day Iran). The colophon, which is in Arabic, gives the name of the scribe, Mīr 'Alī Ḥusaynī Haravī (circa 1476-1543). The manuscript is on a firm cream-colored paper inlaid into light cream (folios 1-8) or pale greenish-blue margin paper, with the writing enclosed within alternating gold and cream (or green) bands with black ruling. The margin paper is profusely decorated with floral and animal motifs. The text is in nastalīq script, eight lines to the page. The binding is contemporary leather with medallions. A former owner's stamp appears on folio 1a. Sufism, a mystical and introspective interpretation of Islam that emerged after the initial spread of the religion, combines Islamic teachings with gnosticism. The practice embraced the idea of enlightenment through spiritual knowledge, informed by pre-Islamic Greek, Zoroastrian, and Indian spiritual practices. By the 13th century, Sufi thought in the Persian-speaking world was expressed primarily through poetry or in poetic works of prose, such as this treatise. World Digital Library. Untitled Sufi text on meditation containing both poetry and prose."

            "This manuscript in Persian is an untitled Sufi text on meditation containing both poetry and prose. It was completed in early 1520, probably in Herat (present-day Afghanistan) or Mashhad (present-day Iran). The colophon, which is in Arabic, gives the name of the scribe, Mīr 'Alī Ḥusaynī Haravī (circa 1476-1543). The manuscript is on a firm cream-colored paper inlaid into light cream (folios 1-8) or pale greenish-blue margin paper, with the writing enclosed within alternating gold and cream (or green) bands with black ruling. The margin paper is profusely decorated with floral and animal motifs. The text is in nastalīq script, eight lines to the page. The binding is contemporary leather with medallions. A former owner's stamp appears on folio 1a. Sufism, a mystical and introspective interpretation of Islam that emerged after the initial spread of the religion, combines Islamic teachings with gnosticism. The practice embraced the idea of enlightenment through spiritual knowledge, informed by pre-Islamic Greek, Zoroastrian, and Indian spiritual practices. By the 13th century, Sufi thought in the Persian-speaking world was expressed primarily through poetry or in poetic works of prose, such as this treatise. World Digital Library.",

          "Shiite prayer book; consists of prayers to be said on the visitation of Caliph ʻAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib's tomb. This manuscript of Durrat al-tāj (The crown jewel) is a Shiite prayer book, consisting of prayers to be said when making a visitation to the tomb of Caliph ʻAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61). 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. The manuscript was probably written in Iran, possibly in the 17th century. The paper is of a thick, cream-colored polished Middle Eastern style, without distinctive chain or laid lines, and no watermark. The text is written in black ink in naskhī script, nine lines on each page, with gold decorations between lines. The borders of the written area are lined with black ink, with profuse decoration outside of the written area. The text is rubricated. The title was added by a later hand. There is no colophon. The binding is referred to as chahargusheh, meaning a frame binding made around a Kashmiri shawl dating from the first half of the 1700s (circa 1740s). World Digital Library."

            "This manuscript of Durrat al-tāj (The crown jewel) is a Shiite prayer book, consisting of prayers to be said when making a visitation to the tomb of Caliph ʻAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61). 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. The manuscript was probably written in Iran, possibly in the 17th century. The paper is of a thick, cream-colored polished Middle Eastern style, without distinctive chain or laid lines, and no watermark. The text is written in black ink in naskhī script, nine lines on each page, with gold decorations between lines. The borders of the written area are lined with black ink, with profuse decoration outside of the written area. The text is rubricated. The title was added by a later hand. There is no colophon. The binding is referred to as chahargusheh, meaning a frame binding made around a Kashmiri shawl dating from the first half of the 1700s (circa 1740s). World Digital Library."

          "Caliph 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61) is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. Shown here is an illuminated 18th-century manuscript copy of the Munājāt (Supplication) of ʻAli ibn Abī Ṭālib. Included are both the original Arabic and a translation into Persian. The text is written on a moderately heavy cream-colored paper in gold (folio 1b and 2a) and black ink (folio 2b to the end) within five borders.

The pages are divided into four boxes to accommodate the main text and the translation, three containing two lines and one containing one line, or seven lines for each page.

An unknown Persian text appears on folio 1a, part of which is missing along the left margin due to trimming and on the upper-right margin due to damage to the first folio (mended with some loss of this text but no damage to main text).

            "Caliph 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61) is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. Shown here is an illuminated 18th-century manuscript copy of the Munājāt (Supplication) of ʻAli ibn Abī Ṭālib. Included are both the original Arabic and a translation into Persian. The text is written on a moderately heavy cream-colored paper in gold (folio 1b and 2a) and black ink (folio 2b to the end) within five borders. The borders are colored in, from the outermost to the innermost, in blue, red, gold, red, and green. The pages are divided into four boxes to accommodate the main text and the translation, three containing two lines and one containing one line, or seven lines for each page. The Arabic text, in naskhi script, is in larger boxes with elaborate interlinear decoration; the Persian translation, in nastaʻlīq script, is in narrower boxes with panels of floral decoration on either side. An unknown Persian text appears on folio 1a, part of which is missing along the left margin due to trimming and on the upper-right margin due to damage to the first folio (mended with some loss of this text but no damage to main text). The name and date \"Vahīd Ḥusaynī 1209\" (1794 or 1795) appears at the lower-left corner of the written area of folio 7b; an unknown Persian text in a later hand appears on the endpaper.

          "Memoirs of the author on the socio-political history of Tajikistan during early 20th century. Yāddāsht-i yak musāfir (Memoirs of a traveler) is an account of the political and social history of the Tajikistan in the early 20th century, written from a pro-Soviet and pro-Russian perspective. The author, Fazl Ahmad Afghan, writes of leaving Afghanistan for neighboring Tajikistan near the turn of the century and records his observations about the remarkable progress made by the Tajik people in subsequent decades. He begins his history with the Emirate of Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan) on the eve of its annexation by imperial Russia in the 1860s and 1870s. The author emphasizes the backward character of this polity (placing special emphasis on the licentiousness of the clergy) and the hopeless plight of those living within its borders. Annexation by Russia brings some improvement in the form of the telegraph and postal service and other symbols of progress, but these changes only benefit the ruling class, leaving the working class to languish as before. The main portion of the book offers a glowing (and one-sided) account of the progress achieved in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the formation of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. Areas of progress in the author's view include improved health care and education, equality for women, and an equitable system of control over the agricultural and industrial production by the working class. A notable feature of the early history of the Tajik Republic is that it was initially formed as an entity within the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Writing in the mid-1930s, the author treats the secession of the Tajik Republic from the Uzbek Republic, which occurred in 1929, as not yet fully actualized. Several of the illustrations in the book depict public buildings said to serve the working class in the post-revolutionary period. The section on the period of imperial Russian rule includes an illustration of revolutionary Tajiks condemned to die for their seditious activities, while the section on the rule of the Emirate of Bukhara includes an illustration of an anonymous and fictitious victim of torture. The final chapter concerns the history of contemporary Afghanistan, but virtually all of the text for this section is missing. The final surviving portion of the book is a condemnation of British capitalism and its exploitation of Egypt, Iran, and Afghanistan, and a presentation of the argument that were these nations to be freed of foreign influence, they could share in the progress made by the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic.

          "Historical study of Bukhoro, Uzbekistan written by the Amir of Bokhara. This work is a history of Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan), written by Said Mir Mohammed Alim Khan (1880-1944), the last amir of Bukhara. Between 1785 and 1920 Bukhara was ruled by eight amirs of the Manghit dynasty. After the Russian conquest of Samarkand in 1868, the emirate of Bukhara became a Russian protectorate. Alim Khan assumed power in 1910, following the death of his father, Abdulahad Khan. Alim Khan was overthrown by the Red Army in September 1920, went into exile, and eventually settled in Kabul, Afghanistan. The title of the book, The Anguish of Nations, alludes to the suffering of his people under communist rule. The text, in Persian, is dated 1921, but the book contains a map of Bukhara and its border with Afghanistan, in French and with information about events after 1925. The illustrations include several photographs of the amir. World Digital Library."

          "Extensive historical study of Amir Timur's conquests of Afghan and Iranian cities. Kulliyat-e Farsi Taymurnamah (literally, The biographical account of Timur) is a biography of Timur or Tamerlane (1336-1405), the Turkic-Mongolian founder of the Timurid dynasty and lineage. It chronicles in detail his personal, political, and military life, including campaigns and conquests, and events in the regions of present-day Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Iran. Many biographies of Timur were produced during his lifetime and after. This lithographed version was published in Tashkent by Matba-e Ghulam Hasan in 1912. The last page of the introduction (pages 2-7) states that this book was written in 1792 during the reign of Shah Murad, founder of the emirate of Bukhara. The full name of the author, Mirza Muhamamd Qasim Ibn Abdul Khaliq Bukhari, appears on the cover, but no other information about him is provided. The introduction to this copy is a typical Persian historiographical trope praising God's supremacy and linking the rise of a ruler, Timur, to divine sanction. The author emphasizes that this connection also held true with the prophets, from Abraham to Muhammad, and for the first four caliphs of Islam, Abu Bakr, Umar, Usman, and Ali. On page four the author states that \"humanity\" is of two types, firstly the prophets, then the kings, as protectors of religion, makers and keepers of peace, and defenders of justice with courage and bravery. (He says nothing about people who do not fit either of these categories.) Timur (Amir Timur Gorgan) is seen as the latter type, \"unquestionably brave, and conqueror of the world from Bulgaria to China, and the ruler of Iran and Turan.\" The author refers to other biographers of Timur, including Qazi Abdul Wakil and Abdul Razzaq Samarqandi. He covers Timur's family background, coronation as a ruler in Balkh in 1369-70, and his military campaigns. The work also expands beyond the life of Timur to cover events relating to the lives of his descendants, including the coronation of Mirza Shahrukh as a dynast in Herat, the rise of Babur as emperor in Khorasan and India, and the emergence of the Uzbeks and Safavids as new political lineages in Mawaranahr, Khorasan, and Iran. Particular historical events, individual figures, and narratives are marked with bold subheadings within the text and above. The first dastan (narrative) on pages eight to 15 concerns the birth of Timur. The last dastan is on his death and briefly discusses his descendants, notably his 34 sons and his many grandchildren. Notes and the signatures of anonymous readers, or perhaps of the author, appear in the margins of the text, as well as seals and stamps of many other readers on the last page of the book. The work is about 440 pages, paginated with Indo-Arabic numerals. World Digital Library."

          "Memoirs of Timur originally written in Chagatay, now lost, translated into Persian by the Mughal scholar Abū Ṭālib al-Ḥusaynī. The 14th-century Turkic-Mongol ruler Timur (Tamerlane) wrote a memoir in Chagatai Turkish, the original of which is now lost. The work was intended as a book of advice for princes and rulers and has been given various titles over the years, including, as in this manuscript, Malfūẓāt (Utterances). The memoir was translated into Persian by Abu Talib al-Husayni, who appears to have been a Shia scholar-official from Khorasan in the service of the Mughal rulers in India in the 1630s. Al-Husayni discovered a Turkish version of the manuscript in the library of an Ottoman governor in Yemen, which he used as the basis for his translation. Al-Husayni dedicated his translation to Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628-58), who apparently disliked it and demanded revisions, which were done by Muhammad Afzal Bakhtiyari. This copy of al-Husayni's translation was probably produced somewhere in India in the mid-19th century. The manuscript contains only one of the many versions of Timur's memoir to have been written and revised over the centuries. It begins with a preface (folios 1-4) in which Bakhtiyari offers a note of praise to God, Muhammad, the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and the Timurid sultans. The preface also contains the title of the manuscript; a brief mention of the story of its discovery, translation into Persian, and revision; and remarks on its usefulness for future princes and statesmen, along with a commentary on the childhood and kingly life of Timur. This is followed by a brief section entitled \"Divinely-Inspired Twelve Principles of Timur\" (folios 4-5). Among the 12 principles by which Timur was said to have been inspired are \"Just Rule,\" \"Differentiation between Truth and Falsehood,\" and \"Following God's Laws.\" The bulk of the manuscript (folios 5-653) covers events in the life of Timur. The narrative is in the first person, and begins with the appointment of the four viziers. Some of the events are titled with red subheadings, while others are not. A final section (folios 653-55) describes Timur being on the road to conquer China, the illness he contracts on the way, his wasiyat (will), and death. The manuscript is written in thick nastaʻliq script, although not in one hand, indicating that it was copied by one or more persons at different times. Turkish Chagatai quotations with Persian translations appear in various places in the text. Pagination is in Arabic numerals. There are numerous repetitions, tautologies, and obscurities throughout the text, reflecting the influence of the many official and unofficial biographies and memoirs of Timur that have been copied and recopied into various languages over the centuries by different individuals and for different purposes. These \"Books of Timur,\" of different genres and titles, were patronized and popularized mainly by Mughal rulers of India in the 17th and 18th centuries. World Digital Library."

          "Jaz̲b al-qulūb ilá diyār al-maḥbūb (The attraction of hearts to the house of the beloved) by ʻAbd al-Haqq ibn Sayf al-Din Dihlavi (1551-1642) is a work in 17 chapters on the history and lore of the city of Medina. Surpassed only by Mecca in its importance to Muslims, Medina houses the tombs of the Prophet Muhammad and some of his close companions. The Hegira (or Hejira, the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina, then known as Yathrib) in 622 was a pivotal moment in Islamic history and serves as the origin of the Islamic calendar. In the introduction of the work, Sayf al-Din lists Wafā' al-wafā' bi akhbār dār al-muṣṭafā̄ (The exhaustive history of the house of the Chosen One) by Nur al-Din Abu al-Hasan al-Samhudi (1440-1506) as his main reference. He also states that he commenced writing his work during a visit to Medina in 998 AH (1589-90) and completed it in Delhi in 1001 AH (1592-93). Although Sayf al-Din discusses the customs involved in the pilgrimage to Medina, the focus for much of his work is on the physical fabric of the city and the architecture of its religious and secular spaces (much of which has fallen into decay or been subject to deliberate dismantling in the intervening centuries). The present volume is the third edition of this work, printed and published by the famed Newal Kishore Press in Lucknow, India, in 1914. World Digital Library. On Prophet Muḥammad, -632; and history of Medina, Saudi Arabia."

          "The first volume of a two volume work which in all covers 170 years. The first volume covers the years from the birth of the last Mongol ruler of Persia Abū Saʻīd (704/1304/5) until the death of Abū S aʻīd, the granson of Tīmūr (807/1405). This manuscript is volume one of Matla us-Sadain wa Majma ul-Baahrain (The rising of the propitious twin stars and the amalgamation of the oceans) by 'Abd al-Razzāq Kamāl al-Dīn ibn Isḥāq al-Samarqandī (1413-82). The book offers a semi-official account of the political history of the late Mongol khanates and Timurid polities in the Caucasus, Iran, Khorasan, and Mawarannahr. Volume one documents the period from 1316, when Abu Said Bahadur Khan, the last great Mongol khan, came to power in Persia, to the death in 1405 of Timur, founder of the Timurid line. This period is central to the history of the region as a time of important social and political transitions. The work recounts how the Mongol khanates disintegrated, various local Mongol and non-Mongol lineages competed for supremacy, and the Timurid lineage established itself as the dominant political and social group. This volume describes Timur, his rise to power, and his immediate descendants. Timur was succeeded by his son Shahrukh, under whom Razzaq prospered as a legal courtier, trustee, and ambassador. Razzaq's ambassadorial missions took him to various places in Eurasia, for example to Calicut in the southwest of India in 1442. The major figures and events described in volume one of Razzaq's work are also described in other contemporary texts. Volume two recounts the reigns of Shahrukh and his descendants, and covers the accession to the throne of Sultan Ḥusain Bāyqarā Chorasan and other events to which the author was eyewitness. The descriptive preface praises God, Muhammad, and the four guided caliphs in Islam. It explains that Razzaq long had wanted to write a history but was prevented from doing so by political instability and other problems. However, one year at Nowruz (New Year) his old friend Shikh Maza al-Din Husain encouraged him to finish writing his text. The events are described chronologically, using the Islamic calendar. The title of each event, verses from Qur'an, and poems all are rubricated. Events usually start with one of the following phrases: \"mention of,\" \"the event of,\" and \"sending of.\" Pages are numbered but numbers do not show on some early pages because of water damage; folio 11 is missing.

          "Manuscript is incomplete; text breaks off abruptly at second word of line 5, leaf 257a. Tārīkh-i Nādirī (The history of Nadir) is a historical work that chronicles the political and military career of Nadir Shah, who was born in 1688 and rose to power in Iran during the 1720s; he became shah in 1736. (This work is also known as Jahāngushāy-i Nādirī in reference to the celebrated history of Genghis Khan, whom Nadir Shah admired.) Nadir Shah is known as a military warrior famous for his campaigns in Iran, Afghanistan, northern India, and Central Asia. He was assassinated by his officers in June 1747. The name of the author of this work, Muhammad Mahdi Munshi' ibn Muhammad Nasir (also seen as Mahdi Khan Astarabadi), appears on page four. Mahdi Khan was a court secretary, historian, and close confidante of Nadir Shah, whom he accompanied on many of his campaigns, so the work is an important historical source. The manuscript is organized chronologically and recounts about 100 military and political events. The preliminary pages contain a preface outlining the political developments in Iran and Qandahar (or Kandahar) that led to the Afghan invasion of Persia in 1722 and the emergence of Nadir Shah as a ruler who would confront and eventually defeat the Afghans and other enemies. The manuscript is incomplete, with the scribe having stopped mid-sentence after completing several lines from the penultimate section of the work, \"On the end of the [Nadir Shah] and the manner of his murder...\". Virtually all of this penultimate section (chronicling the cruel and bloody final years of Nadir's reign) and the final section (on the rule of ʻAli Quli Khan and Ibrahim Khan, nephews of Nadir, who each claimed the throne for a brief period after the assassination of their uncle) are therefore missing from the manuscript. The missing parts correspond roughly to six pages of text. In the manner typical of Persian court historiography, the author emphasizes throughout the restoration of order, the introduction of justice, and the defeat of the enemies of the state. Various poems and verses from the Qur'an appear throughout the text. The manuscript is written by a single hand in a uniform nastaliq, the calligraphic Persian script. All of the events recounted have a rubricated title. The first word of every other page is repeated as a \"catchword\" in the bottom margin of the previous page to ensure the proper order of the pages prior to binding, as was common practice in Persia and elsewhere.

          "Historical study of Iran and Afghanistan during the reign of Nādir Shāh, 1688-1747. Waqiat-i Nadiri (literally \"Events of Nadir\") is a historical manuscript that chronicles the political and military career of Nādir Shāh, who was born in 1688 and rose to power in Iran during the 1720s; he became shah in 1736. He is known as a military warrior famous for his campaigns in Iran, Afghanistan, northern India, and Central Asia. He was assassinated by his officers in June 1747. The name of the author of this work, Muḥammad Mahdī Munshi' ibn Muḥammad Naṣīr (also seen as Mahdī Khān Astarābādī), appears on page four. Mahdi Khan was a court secretary, historian, and close confidante of Nādir Shāh, whom he accompanied on many of his campaigns, so the work is an important historical source. The manuscript is organized chronologically and recounts about 100 military and political events. The preliminary pages contain a preface outlining the political events in Iran and Qandahar (or Kandahar) that led to the Afghan invasion of Isfahan in 1722 and the emergence of Nādir Shāh as a ruler who would confront and eventually defeat the Afghans and other enemies. The preface is followed by a biography of Mahmud Hotaki, an Afghan commander who defeated the Safavids and briefly ruled in Isfahan. The last part of the manuscript covers the reigns of Ali Shah and Ebrahim Shah, nephews of Nādir Shāh, each of whom claimed the throne in Isfahan for brief times in the aftermath of Nādir Shāh's assassination. In the manner typical of Persian court historiography, the author emphasizes throughout the restoration of order, the introduction of justice, and the defeat of the enemies of the state. The margins contain notes, probably by anonymous readers. Various poems and verses from the Qur'an appear throughout the text. The manuscript is written in different styles of broken nastaliq, the calligraphic Persian script. All of the events recounted have a rubricated title and are organized and described in terms of their outcomes or final causes, usually in a page or a half page. The manuscript is numbered in pencil in the Indo-Arabic numeral style, probably by an anonymous reader. World Digital Library."

          "Historical study of Iran and Afghanistan during the reign of Nādir Shāh, 1688-1747. Tārīkh-i jahānkushā-yi Nādirī (The history of the world-conquering Nāder) is a historical study of Iran and Afghanistan during the reign of Nāder Shah (1736-47), written by a contemporary. Nāder was born in 1688 into a humble pastoral family. He established his reputation as a skilled military commander in fighting with Afghan forces that had invaded Iran in 1719 and that for a time occupied Isfahan. He assumed the throne as ruler of Iran in March 1736. His reign was marked by wars with the Afghans, Mughals, Dagestanis, and Ottomans, and he eventually ruled over an empire that included Iran, northern India, and parts of Central Asia. Nāder was assassinated by a cabal of his officers in June 1747. This book was published as a lithographic print in 1875. The former owner's stamps appear on the verso of the title page and on page 3; catchwords are on the page versos. Lithographic printing was invented in Europe in the late 18th century and spread widely on the Indian subcontinent from the early 19th century onward, its popularity stemming from the relative ease with which it could be used to reproduce different scripts not based on the Latin alphabet.

            "Tārīkh-i jahānkushā-yi Nādirī (The history of the world-conquering Nāder) is a historical study of Iran and Afghanistan during the reign of Nāder Shah (1736-47), written by a contemporary. Nāder was born in 1688 into a humble pastoral family. He established his reputation as a skilled military commander in fighting with Afghan forces that had invaded Iran in 1719 and that for a time occupied Isfahan. He assumed the throne as ruler of Iran in March 1736. His reign was marked by wars with the Afghans, Mughals, Dagestanis, and Ottomans, and he eventually ruled over an empire that included Iran, northern India, and parts of Central Asia. Nāder was assassinated by a cabal of his officers in June 1747. This book was published as a lithographic print in 1875. The former owner's stamps appear on the verso of the title page and on page 3; catchwords are on the page versos. Lithographic printing was invented in Europe in the late 18th century and spread widely on the Indian subcontinent from the early 19th century onward, its popularity stemming from the relative ease with which it could be used to reproduce different scripts not based on the Latin alphabet.

          "Historical study of Iran during the Qajar dynasty in 19th century and of Afghanistan during the rules of Shīr ʻAlī Khān, ʻAbdurraḥmān K̲h̲ān̲ and Ḥabīb Allāh Khān. Kullīyāt-i Riyāz̤ī (Riyazi's book, usually known in English as the Collected Works of Ryazi) is a literary-historical work written in a mixture of prose and verse styles and published in a lithographic version in Mashhad, Iran, in 1906. It chronicles social, cultural, and political events taking place in the second-half of the 19th century in Afghanistan and Persia, especially during the reigns of Afghan ruler ʻAbd al-Rahman Khan (1880-1901) and his Persian counterpart, Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar (1896-1907). The author, Muhammad Yusuf Riyazi Haravi, was from a family of bureaucrats; his father had served different local Afghan officials in Herat. Historians generally have used colonial sources in their study of late-19th century Iran and Afghanistan; this book is a local historical source for the study of relations between these two countries and their formation. Muhammad Yusuf received support from Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar, who is praised as a just and learned ruler. The author also provides rich descriptions of his own family background, childhood education, travels, and his move to Qajar Iran and the confiscation of his and his family's property in Herat. The book includes a preface, table of contents, 12 chapters, and an extra section. The preface contains a 48-line verse and a prose section praising God, Muhammad, the family of ʻAli, the Qajar dynasts, and the author's own family. Chapter 1 describes the family background of the author. Chapter 2 contains several hikayat (stories) describing cities, political regions, and individuals; this chapter also includes a section on Afghanistan. Chapter 3, the longest, documents events in late-19th century Afghanistan and elsewhere, such as the signing of a friendship treaty between China and Japan, the death of a prime minister in the Ottoman Empire, and the Greek-Ottoman Wars. Chapter 4, called \"Book of Knowledge,\" discusses \"12 types of knowledge.\" Chapter 5, entitled \"Questions and Answers,\" describes ten encounters with different individuals in which various topics are discussed, for example, with a German traveler about religious laws in Islamic countries, and with an English officer about why Muslims do not send their children to Europe for schooling. Chapter 6 contains spiritual ghazal (lyric poems). Chapter 7, \"The Source of Crying,\" also has spiritual poems. Chapter 8 contains quintet poems, here called takhmisat. Chapter 9 is only one page and appears to be incomplete; it contains a few quintet and quatrain poems. Chapter 10, \"Book of Regrets,\" discusses 12 different topics, for example, the finite character of the world and the nature of worship. Chapter 11, \"Situations of Cities and Countries,\" is a brief ethnographic account of Beijing, Kabul, Mashhad, and other places. Chapter 12 offers a conclusion; it also describes the recently concluded Russo-Japanese War (1904-5). The book ends with a section, Mulh'qat (Relevancies), which covers a seemingly random set of topics, including a hunting campaign in 1904 of Amir Habibullah Khan, nationalist activities in Greece, and the salaries of poets in Herat. This work clearly was written at different times and published by the author as single collection. Each chapter forms a unit, and there are no direct connections between them. The book contains lithographic images, including of the Qajar and Afghan rulers and of the author. World Digital Library."

          "Tavarikh-i Khurshid-i Jahan (literally, Histories of the sun of the world) is primarily a history of Afghan Pushtun (or Pashtun) ancestry. It describes Afghan Pushtun genealogies, the various lineages, and the many political events, wars, and polities, such as the Safavid and Mughal dynasties in Khorasan and India, with which the Pushtuns have historically been identified. The book is arranged in four sections. Section one is a detailed list of contents. Section two begins with a preface containing the names of the author, patron, and contributor and proclaims that the work is \"to be a book of history of Afghan Pushtun ancestry since the creation of Adam.\" This section covers the various popular genealogical legends of the Afghan Pushtuns, chief among them that they are descendants of one of the tribes of Israelites, specifically children of Saul, the first king of Israel. Section three is the main text and has eight chapters devoted to the history of the Pushtuns. An epilogue, written both in prose and verse, gives the author's name, publication details, and a brief conclusion of the contents of the book. Tables charting the various genealogies of Afghan Pushtuns with detailed introductions to each lineage appear in several chapters. For example, tables outlining the descent of the Barakzais, Alokzais, Mohmands, Kakars, and other families appear on pages 188-319. These genealogical tables are followed by detailed discussions. The book was published in 1894 in Lahore (present-day Pakistan). The full name of the author, Sher Muḥammad Khān Saheb Gandapur Ibrahim Zai (circa 1837-1902), appears on the cover of the book. He most likely was a Gandapur Pushtun and an official appointed by the British in the municipality of Kulachi in Dera Ismail Khan, one of the administrative centers in the Northwest Frontier Province of British India. The preface says that he had written another historical work called Gulshan-i Afghanistan (Flower garden of Afghanistan), published under the title Hayat-i Afghani (Ancestry of the Afghans). Sher Muḥammad Khān claims that Hayat-i Afghani fell into the hands of Mohammad Hayat Khan Saheb, a judicial official in Bannu District of the province, who published it under his own name; the veracity of this claim has not been proven. It is clear, however, that Tavarīkh-i Khurshid-i Jahan was published under the patronage of Sardar Mohammad Hayat Khan Saheb, who could possibly have been the same official. The 319 pages of the work are numbered with Indo-Arabic numerals. World Digital Library."

                "Ẓuhūr al-amān (The advent of security) is a book on civics published during the reign of Ammanullah Khan (1919-29) as amir of Afghanistan. The book's title pays homage to the name of Ammanullah Khan himself. In its treatment of the duties of the members of Afghan society to the ruler and to each other, Ẓuhūr al-amān appears to highlight the challenges faced by Ammanullah Khan in his efforts to modernize Afghanistan. The book is divided into more than 30 short chapters describing the rights and responsibilities of the ruler, of persons living within a family unit, and of members of Afghan society as a whole. Some sections, such as one on the rights that are to be afforded to the king (ḥuquq-i lazima bar padishah), are further divided into subsections. The book begins with several chapters on religious matters, including those on tauhid (the unity of God), on ʻibada (worship), and on fahm-i sharīʻat-i rasūl ʻalayhi al-salām (the sharia). Ẓuhūr al-amān was published on October 11, 1923, by the then newly established Ministry of Education. The author of the work, a religious scholar by the name of ʻAbd al-Haqq, lists his father as ʻAbd al-ʻAziz from the village of Lower Arghanda in the township of Paghman, near Kabul.  He highlights, as well, his tribal affiliation with the well-known Pushtun tribe of Suleimankhel. World Digital Library."

Nashki was the calligraphic style used for the most beautiful Qurʼans of the period, because of its small size and great delicacy. The first two pages are elaborately illuminated in green, blue, and red on a gold background. The titles of the surahs (chapters) are in gold. The borders are in gold, blue, and red. The colophon is illuminated in gold and colors. Probably of Persian origin, this Qurʼan was copied in Arabic by Kohazadeh Ahmad Rashid Safi and decorated by Adham Gharbaldeh al-Balawi.

                "Commentary and explanation of some Qurʼānic verses. Kashf al-asrār (The unveiling of mysteries) is a book of Qur'anic commentary dating from the early 20th century. The author, Shir Ahmad, was from Kabul, Afghanistan. In the Kashf al-asrār, Shir Ahmad makes repeated reference to an earlier and more comprehensive commentary but states that, because of the great bulk of the earlier work, he was forced to write a short text dealing with various essential topics. The Kashf al-asrār is organized as an introduction and 13 sections, with each section treating a collection of related verses from the Qur'an. Shir Ahmad writes the introduction in Persian, in which he makes a customary plea about the potential shortcomings of his work. In the subsequent section the commentary is in Arabic. The Qur'anic verses under consideration are written in the same color and in the same naskh calligraphy as the commentary, but they are set off by use of a larger script size. Somewhat unexpectedly, Shir Ahmad switches back to a Persian commentary (written in the nasta'liq calligraphic style) mid-way through the subsequent section. The work concludes with a table of contents. Shir Ahmad's Kashf al-asrār shares its name with a number of works, including a celebrated 12th century Qur'anic commentary by Rashid al-Din Maybudi. The book was printed and published in 1910 or 1911 in Kabul by Matbaʻah-i ʻUmumi. World Digital Library."

                "On recitation and reading of the Qurʼān. This work is an introduction to the rules of pronunciation during the recitation of the Qur'an. It was written for students at the elementary and intermediate levels in Afghanistan. In the preface the author states that in teaching the rules of proper pronunciation, the focus should be on skills that young Persian- or Pushto-speaking students have not been exposed to, e.g., the proper pronunciation of letters in Arabic, mudd (prolongation), awqaf (pause), and other topics. The book begins with a list of makharij (emission points) for the letters. These are listed as 17 locations in the throat, tongue, lips, nose, and mouth. The conventions for sounding the letters are divided into various categories. For the letter nun (n) the following cases are listed: izhar (clarity, i.e., the clear pronunciation of the letter if it is following by \"letters of the throat\" such as the ʻayin); idgham (merging, i.e., of two consecutive words, when the first word ends in a nun, and the second word is followed by ra', r, or lam, l); iqlab (conversion, i.e., the conversion of the nun to a mim, m, if it is followed by a ba', b); and ikhfa' (concealment, which covers the remaining cases for the letter nun, and is accompanied by a ghunnah, or nasalization). A previous owner has added occasional corrections to the text. The work was published in the year 1300 AH of the solar Islamic calendar, corresponding to 1921 or 1922. This anonymously written work was printed at the Ministry of Education Press in Kabul, under the auspices of Muhammad Sulayman Khan, who served as minister of education under Amanullah Khan (reigned 1919-29).

                "Risālah-i Puṣhto It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr (On the obedience of the ruler in Pashto) is a tract meant to encourage obedience to the ruler of Afghanistan. The expression ūlā al-amr refers to one who is foremost in authority, and the title of the book references a Qur'anic verse (5:59), \"Oh Believers! Obey the Lord and the Prophet and those who are foremost in authority amongst you,\" which is quoted at the beginning of the work. Numerous quotes from the hadith literature (primarily from the collection of al-Bukhari) follow. The Arabic text of each hadith is followed by an explanation in Pashto, several of which equate disobedience with jahāla (ignorance, i.e. of religious precepts) and contrast it with shahāda (bearing testimony or witness to Islam). The aim of the work is thus plainly the garnering of legitimacy and authority for the then-ruling Afghan emir, Habibullah Khan (reigned 1901-19). The Persian original of this work was composed by Maulawi ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan (1878 or 1879-1919), who, ironically, appears to have been jailed for his involvement in the constitutional movement in the early 1900s against the authoritarianism of Habibullah Khan. By the time he composed the It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr, ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan was serving Habibullah Khan in the role of mullā-i darbār (court theologian). Both ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan and the translator, Salih Muhammad, were teachers at the Habibiya School founded by Habibullah Khan. The Pashto translation of It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr was printed by the Dar al-Saltanah press in Kabul. The cover states that it is the first Pashto work printed in Afghanistan, and that it was meant to be distributed free of charge. World Digital Library."

                "Tuḥfat al-ʻulamā' (An offering for religious scholars) is ostensibly a tract addressed to the ʻulamā' (religious scholars) of Afghanistan, asking them to actively discourage the suspicion held by their followers toward things foreign. It was written by order of the Afghan ruler Sher Ali Khan (reigned 1863-66 and 1868-79). Little is known of the author, ʻAbd al-Qadir Khan, although he is identified as a qāḍī (judge) indicating his religious authority. ʻAbd al-Qadir uses numerous quotations from the hadith literature to argue that practices originating with \"non-believers\" may be in accordance with the sharia provided these practices benefit the Islamic ummah (community). The foreign practices in question mostly have to do with the military--that military spending and a strong military are consistent with Islamic teachings remain major themes throughout the work. Although the heavy reliance on the Qur'an, the hadith, and quotations by learned men in the Islamic tradition (such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Muhammad al-Ghazali) demonstrate the expertise and the erudition of the author (or, possibly, authors), the polemical and often repetitious arguments serve to emphasize the purely propagandistic aspects of Tuḥfat al-ʻulamā'. The timing of the publication is noteworthy. For much of his career Sher Ali Khan was in the enviable position of managing the conflicting interests of tsarist Russia and Great Britain, two colonial powers locked in the \"Great Game\" for mastery over Afghanistan. The publication of Tuḥfat al-ʻulamā' in 1875 predates the Second Anglo-Afghan War (and Sher Ali's retreat from Kabul) by several years. The book was published in the Mustafawi printing press, which was founded by Sher Ali Khan, and is one of the earliest works printed in Afghanistan. World Digital Library."

                "Written in India by an unknown author in the final decades of the 19th century, Ghāyat al-shuʻūr bi-ḥujaj al-ḥajj al-mabrūr (The utmost knowledge of the arguments for the blessed Hajj) describes the various observances associated with the Hajj pilgrimage. The introduction and the text are written in Arabic, but the main text is in Persian, as are two appended texts (by a different author), a taqriz (encomium) praising Ghāyat al-shuʻūr, and a shorter versified text directed against critics of the work. The main text is dedicated by the author to a nobleman by the name of Rahim al-Din. The afterword states that the work is a second edition, printed in 1290 AH (1873) by the famed Newal Kishore Press in Lucknow, the first edition having been printed in Calcutta in 1283 AH (1866-67). Inserted prior to the discussion of the publication date is a chronogram that stands for 1290 AH, i.e., the date of the second edition of the work. The chronogram is credited to a Sayyid Munawwar Husayn, an employee of the court of Awadh (also called Oudh). The nawabs of Awadh were a Persian Shiʻa dynasty that had migrated to India from Nishapur (in present-day Iran) and that actively promulgated Persian letters and Shiʻa beliefs. The Nawabate of Awadh was stripped of power, however, by the British in the aftermath of the Uprising of 1857 (also known as the Sepoy Rebellion), roughly a decade before Ghāyat al-shuʻūr was first published. The mention of the court of Awadh is therefore somewhat anachronistic--a reference to what was by then at best a ceremonial office. World Digital Library."

                  "Written in India by an unknown author in the final decades of the 19th century, Ghāyat al-shuʻūr bi-ḥujaj al-ḥajj al-mabrūr (The utmost knowledge of the arguments for the blessed Hajj) describes the various observances associated with the Hajj pilgrimage. The introduction and the text are written in Arabic, but the main text is in Persian, as are two appended texts (by a different author), a taqriz (encomium) praising Ghāyat al-shuʻūr, and a shorter versified text directed against critics of the work. The main text is dedicated by the author to a nobleman by the name of Rahim al-Din. The afterword states that the work is a second edition, printed in 1290 AH (1873) by the famed Newal Kishore Press in Lucknow, the first edition having been printed in Calcutta in 1283 AH (1866-67). Inserted prior to the discussion of the publication date is a chronogram that stands for 1290 AH, i.e., the date of the second edition of the work. The chronogram is credited to a Sayyid Munawwar Husayn, an employee of the court of Awadh (also called Oudh). The nawabs of Awadh were a Persian Shiʻa dynasty that had migrated to India from Nishapur (in present-day Iran) and that actively promulgated Persian letters and Shiʻa beliefs. The Nawabate of Awadh was stripped of power, however, by the British in the aftermath of the Uprising of 1857 (also known as the Sepoy Rebellion), roughly a decade before Ghāyat al-shuʻūr was first published. The mention of the court of Awadh is therefore somewhat anachronistic--a reference to what was by then at best a ceremonial office. World Digital Library."

                "This manuscript in Persian is an untitled Sufi text on meditation containing both poetry and prose. It was completed in early 1520, probably in Herat (present-day Afghanistan) or Mashhad (present-day Iran). The colophon, which is in Arabic, gives the name of the scribe, Mīr 'Alī Ḥusaynī Haravī (circa 1476-1543). The manuscript is on a firm cream-colored paper inlaid into light cream (folios 1-8) or pale greenish-blue margin paper, with the writing enclosed within alternating gold and cream (or green) bands with black ruling. The margin paper is profusely decorated with floral and animal motifs. The text is in nastalīq script, eight lines to the page. The binding is contemporary leather with medallions. A former owner's stamp appears on folio 1a. Sufism, a mystical and introspective interpretation of Islam that emerged after the initial spread of the religion, combines Islamic teachings with gnosticism. The practice embraced the idea of enlightenment through spiritual knowledge, informed by pre-Islamic Greek, Zoroastrian, and Indian spiritual practices. By the 13th century, Sufi thought in the Persian-speaking world was expressed primarily through poetry or in poetic works of prose, such as this treatise. World Digital Library.

                "Shiite prayer book; consists of prayers to be said on the visitation of Caliph ʻAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib's tomb. This manuscript of Durrat al-tāj (The crown jewel) is a Shiite prayer book, consisting of prayers to be said when making a visitation to the tomb of Caliph ʻAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61). 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. The manuscript was probably written in Iran, possibly in the 17th century. The paper is of a thick, cream-colored polished Middle Eastern style, without distinctive chain or laid lines, and no watermark. The text is written in black ink in naskhī script, nine lines on each page, with gold decorations between lines. The borders of the written area are lined with black ink, with profuse decoration outside of the written area. The text is rubricated. The title was added by a later hand. There is no colophon. The binding is referred to as chahargusheh, meaning a frame binding made around a Kashmiri shawl dating from the first half of the 1700s (circa 1740s). World Digital Library."

                "Caliph 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61) is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. Shown here is an illuminated 18th-century manuscript copy of the Munājāt (Supplication) of ʻAli ibn Abī Ṭālib. Included are both the original Arabic and a translation into Persian. The text is written on a moderately heavy cream-colored paper in gold (folio 1b and 2a) and black ink (folio 2b to the end) within five borders. The borders are colored in, from the outermost to the innermost, in blue, red, gold, red, and green. The pages are divided into four boxes to accommodate the main text and the translation, three containing two lines and one containing one line, or seven lines for each page. The Arabic text, in naskhi script, is in larger boxes with elaborate interlinear decoration; the Persian translation, in nastaʻlīq script, is in narrower boxes with panels of floral decoration on either side. An unknown Persian text appears on folio 1a, part of which is missing along the left margin due to trimming and on the upper-right margin due to damage to the first folio (mended with some loss of this text but no damage to main text). The name and date \"Vahīd Ḥusaynī 1209\" (1794 or 1795) appears at the lower-left corner of the written area of folio 7b; an unknown Persian text in a later hand appears on the endpaper.

                  "Caliph 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61) is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. Shown here is an illuminated 18th-century manuscript copy of the Munājāt (Supplication) of ʻAli ibn Abī Ṭālib. Included are both the original Arabic and a translation into Persian. The text is written on a moderately heavy cream-colored paper in gold (folio 1b and 2a) and black ink (folio 2b to the end) within five borders. The borders are colored in, from the outermost to the innermost, in blue, red, gold, red, and green. The pages are divided into four boxes to accommodate the main text and the translation, three containing two lines and one containing one line, or seven lines for each page. The Arabic text, in naskhi script, is in larger boxes with elaborate interlinear decoration; the Persian translation, in nastaʻlīq script, is in narrower boxes with panels of floral decoration on either side. An unknown Persian text appears on folio 1a, part of which is missing along the left margin due to trimming and on the upper-right margin due to damage to the first folio (mended with some loss of this text but no damage to main text). The name and date \"Vahīd Ḥusaynī 1209\" (1794 or 1795) appears at the lower-left corner of the written area of folio 7b; an unknown Persian text in a later hand appears on the endpaper.

                "Memoirs of the author on the socio-political history of Tajikistan during early 20th century. Yāddāsht-i yak musāfir (Memoirs of a traveler) is an account of the political and social history of the Tajikistan in the early 20th century, written from a pro-Soviet and pro-Russian perspective. The author, Fazl Ahmad Afghan, writes of leaving Afghanistan for neighboring Tajikistan near the turn of the century and records his observations about the remarkable progress made by the Tajik people in subsequent decades. He begins his history with the Emirate of Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan) on the eve of its annexation by imperial Russia in the 1860s and 1870s. The author emphasizes the backward character of this polity (placing special emphasis on the licentiousness of the clergy) and the hopeless plight of those living within its borders. Annexation by Russia brings some improvement in the form of the telegraph and postal service and other symbols of progress, but these changes only benefit the ruling class, leaving the working class to languish as before. The main portion of the book offers a glowing (and one-sided) account of the progress achieved in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the formation of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. Areas of progress in the author's view include improved health care and education, equality for women, and an equitable system of control over the agricultural and industrial production by the working class. A notable feature of the early history of the Tajik Republic is that it was initially formed as an entity within the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Writing in the mid-1930s, the author treats the secession of the Tajik Republic from the Uzbek Republic, which occurred in 1929, as not yet fully actualized. Several of the illustrations in the book depict public buildings said to serve the working class in the post-revolutionary period. The section on the period of imperial Russian rule includes an illustration of revolutionary Tajiks condemned to die for their seditious activities, while the section on the rule of the Emirate of Bukhara includes an illustration of an anonymous and fictitious victim of torture. The final chapter concerns the history of contemporary Afghanistan, but virtually all of the text for this section is missing. The final surviving portion of the book is a condemnation of British capitalism and its exploitation of Egypt, Iran, and Afghanistan, and a presentation of the argument that were these nations to be freed of foreign influence, they could share in the progress made by the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic.

                  "Yāddāsht-i yak musāfir (Memoirs of a traveler) is an account of the political and social history of the Tajikistan in the early 20th century, written from a pro-Soviet and pro-Russian perspective. The author, Fazl Ahmad Afghan, writes of leaving Afghanistan for neighboring Tajikistan near the turn of the century and records his observations about the remarkable progress made by the Tajik people in subsequent decades. He begins his history with the Emirate of Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan) on the eve of its annexation by imperial Russia in the 1860s and 1870s. The author emphasizes the backward character of this polity (placing special emphasis on the licentiousness of the clergy) and the hopeless plight of those living within its borders. Annexation by Russia brings some improvement in the form of the telegraph and postal service and other symbols of progress, but these changes only benefit the ruling class, leaving the working class to languish as before. The main portion of the book offers a glowing (and one-sided) account of the progress achieved in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the formation of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. Areas of progress in the author's view include improved health care and education, equality for women, and an equitable system of control over the agricultural and industrial production by the working class. A notable feature of the early history of the Tajik Republic is that it was initially formed as an entity within the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Writing in the mid-1930s, the author treats the secession of the Tajik Republic from the Uzbek Republic, which occurred in 1929, as not yet fully actualized. Several of the illustrations in the book depict public buildings said to serve the working class in the post-revolutionary period. The section on the period of imperial Russian rule includes an illustration of revolutionary Tajiks condemned to die for their seditious activities, while the section on the rule of the Emirate of Bukhara includes an illustration of an anonymous and fictitious victim of torture. The final chapter concerns the history of contemporary Afghanistan, but virtually all of the text for this section is missing. The final surviving portion of the book is a condemnation of British capitalism and its exploitation of Egypt, Iran, and Afghanistan, and a presentation of the argument that were these nations to be freed of foreign influence, they could share in the progress made by the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic.

                "Historical study of Bukhoro, Uzbekistan written by the Amir of Bokhara. This work is a history of Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan), written by Said Mir Mohammed Alim Khan (1880-1944), the last amir of Bukhara. Between 1785 and 1920 Bukhara was ruled by eight amirs of the Manghit dynasty. After the Russian conquest of Samarkand in 1868, the emirate of Bukhara became a Russian protectorate. Alim Khan assumed power in 1910, following the death of his father, Abdulahad Khan. Alim Khan was overthrown by the Red Army in September 1920, went into exile, and eventually settled in Kabul, Afghanistan. The title of the book, The Anguish of Nations, alludes to the suffering of his people under communist rule. The text, in Persian, is dated 1921, but the book contains a map of Bukhara and its border with Afghanistan, in French and with information about events after 1925.

                "Extensive historical study of Amir Timur's conquests of Afghan and Iranian cities. Kulliyat-e Farsi Taymurnamah (literally, The biographical account of Timur) is a biography of Timur or Tamerlane (1336-1405), the Turkic-Mongolian founder of the Timurid dynasty and lineage. It chronicles in detail his personal, political, and military life, including campaigns and conquests, and events in the regions of present-day Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Iran. Many biographies of Timur were produced during his lifetime and after. This lithographed version was published in Tashkent by Matba-e Ghulam Hasan in 1912. The last page of the introduction (pages 2-7) states that this book was written in 1792 during the reign of Shah Murad, founder of the emirate of Bukhara. The full name of the author, Mirza Muhamamd Qasim Ibn Abdul Khaliq Bukhari, appears on the cover, but no other information about him is provided. The introduction to this copy is a typical Persian historiographical trope praising God's supremacy and linking the rise of a ruler, Timur, to divine sanction. The author emphasizes that this connection also held true with the prophets, from Abraham to Muhammad, and for the first four caliphs of Islam, Abu Bakr, Umar, Usman, and Ali. On page four the author states that \"humanity\" is of two types, firstly the prophets, then the kings, as protectors of religion, makers and keepers of peace, and defenders of justice with courage and bravery. (He says nothing about people who do not fit either of these categories.) Timur (Amir Timur Gorgan) is seen as the latter type, \"unquestionably brave, and conqueror of the world from Bulgaria to China, and the ruler of Iran and Turan.\" The author refers to other biographers of Timur, including Qazi Abdul Wakil and Abdul Razzaq Samarqandi. He covers Timur's family background, coronation as a ruler in Balkh in 1369-70, and his military campaigns. The work also expands beyond the life of Timur to cover events relating to the lives of his descendants, including the coronation of Mirza Shahrukh as a dynast in Herat, the rise of Babur as emperor in Khorasan and India, and the emergence of the Uzbeks and Safavids as new political lineages in Mawaranahr, Khorasan, and Iran. Particular historical events, individual figures, and narratives are marked with bold subheadings within the text and above. The first dastan (narrative) on pages eight to 15 concerns the birth of Timur. The last dastan is on his death and briefly discusses his descendants, notably his 34 sons and his many grandchildren. Notes and the signatures of anonymous readers, or perhaps of the author, appear in the margins of the text, as well as seals and stamps of many other readers on the last page of the book. The work is about 440 pages, paginated with Indo-Arabic numerals. World Digital Library."

                "Memoirs of Timur originally written in Chagatay, now lost, translated into Persian by the Mughal scholar Abū Ṭālib al-Ḥusaynī. The 14th-century Turkic-Mongol ruler Timur (Tamerlane) wrote a memoir in Chagatai Turkish, the original of which is now lost. The work was intended as a book of advice for princes and rulers and has been given various titles over the years, including, as in this manuscript, Malfūẓāt (Utterances). The memoir was translated into Persian by Abu Talib al-Husayni, who appears to have been a Shia scholar-official from Khorasan in the service of the Mughal rulers in India in the 1630s. Al-Husayni discovered a Turkish version of the manuscript in the library of an Ottoman governor in Yemen, which he used as the basis for his translation. Al-Husayni dedicated his translation to Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628-58), who apparently disliked it and demanded revisions, which were done by Muhammad Afzal Bakhtiyari. This copy of al-Husayni's translation was probably produced somewhere in India in the mid-19th century. The manuscript contains only one of the many versions of Timur's memoir to have been written and revised over the centuries. It begins with a preface (folios 1-4) in which Bakhtiyari offers a note of praise to God, Muhammad, the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and the Timurid sultans. The preface also contains the title of the manuscript; a brief mention of the story of its discovery, translation into Persian, and revision; and remarks on its usefulness for future princes and statesmen, along with a commentary on the childhood and kingly life of Timur. This is followed by a brief section entitled \"Divinely-Inspired Twelve Principles of Timur\" (folios 4-5). Among the 12 principles by which Timur was said to have been inspired are \"Just Rule,\" \"Differentiation between Truth and Falsehood,\" and \"Following God's Laws.\" The bulk of the manuscript (folios 5-653) covers events in the life of Timur. The narrative is in the first person, and begins with the appointment of the four viziers. Some of the events are titled with red subheadings, while others are not. A final section (folios 653-55) describes Timur being on the road to conquer China, the illness he contracts on the way, his wasiyat (will), and death. The manuscript is written in thick nastaʻliq script, although not in one hand, indicating that it was copied by one or more persons at different times. Turkish Chagatai quotations with Persian translations appear in various places in the text. Pagination is in Arabic numerals. There are numerous repetitions, tautologies, and obscurities throughout the text, reflecting the influence of the many official and unofficial biographies and memoirs of Timur that have been copied and recopied into various languages over the centuries by different individuals and for different purposes. These \"Books of Timur,\" of different genres and titles, were patronized and popularized mainly by Mughal rulers of India in the 17th and 18th centuries. World Digital Library."

Al-Husayni dedicated his translation to Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628-58), who apparently disliked it and demanded revisions, which were done by Muhammad Afzal Bakhtiyari. This copy of al-Husayni's translation was probably produced somewhere in India in the mid-19th century. The manuscript contains only one of the many versions of Timur's memoir to have been written and revised over the centuries. It begins with a preface (folios 1-4) in which Bakhtiyari offers a note of praise to God, Muhammad, the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and the Timurid sultans. The preface also contains the title of the manuscript; a brief mention of the story of its discovery, translation into Persian, and revision; and remarks on its usefulness for future princes and statesmen, along with a commentary on the childhood and kingly life of Timur. This is followed by a brief section entitled \"Divinely-Inspired Twelve Principles of Timur\" (folios 4-5). Among the 12 principles by which Timur was said to have been inspired are \"Just Rule,\" \"Differentiation between Truth and Falsehood,\" and \"Following God's Laws.\" The bulk of the manuscript (folios 5-653) covers events in the life of Timur. The narrative is in the first person, and begins with the appointment of the four viziers. Some of the events are titled with red subheadings, while others are not. A final section (folios 653-55) describes Timur being on the road to conquer China, the illness he contracts on the way, his wasiyat (will), and death. The manuscript is written in thick nastaʻliq script, although not in one hand, indicating that it was copied by one or more persons at different times. Turkish Chagatai quotations with Persian translations appear in various places in the text. Pagination is in Arabic numerals. There are numerous repetitions, tautologies, and obscurities throughout the text, reflecting the influence of the many official and unofficial biographies and memoirs of Timur that have been copied and recopied into various languages over the centuries by different individuals and for different purposes. These \"Books of Timur,\" of different genres and titles, were patronized and popularized mainly by Mughal rulers of India in the 17th and 18th centuries. World Digital Library."

Surpassed only by Mecca in its importance to Muslims, Medina houses the tombs of the Prophet Muhammad and some of his close companions. The Hegira (or Hejira, the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina, then known as Yathrib) in 622 was a pivotal moment in Islamic history and serves as the origin of the Islamic calendar. In the introduction of the work, Sayf al-Din lists Wafā' al-wafā' bi akhbār dār al-muṣṭafā̄ (The exhaustive history of the house of the Chosen One) by Nur al-Din Abu al-Hasan al-Samhudi (1440-1506) as his main reference. He also states that he commenced writing his work during a visit to Medina in 998 AH (1589-90) and completed it in Delhi in 1001 AH (1592-93). Although Sayf al-Din discusses the customs involved in the pilgrimage to Medina, the focus for much of his work is on the physical fabric of the city and the architecture of its religious and secular spaces (much of which has fallen into decay or been subject to deliberate dismantling in the intervening centuries). The present volume is the third edition of this work, printed and published by the famed Newal Kishore Press in Lucknow, India, in 1914. World Digital Library.

                "The first volume of a two volume work which in all covers 170 years. The first volume covers the years from the birth of the last Mongol ruler of Persia Abū Saʻīd (704/1304/5) until the death of Abū S aʻīd, the granson of Tīmūr (807/1405). This manuscript is volume one of Matla us-Sadain wa Majma ul-Baahrain (The rising of the propitious twin stars and the amalgamation of the oceans) by 'Abd al-Razzāq Kamāl al-Dīn ibn Isḥāq al-Samarqandī (1413-82). The book offers a semi-official account of the political history of the late Mongol khanates and Timurid polities in the Caucasus, Iran, Khorasan, and Mawarannahr. Volume one documents the period from 1316, when Abu Said Bahadur Khan, the last great Mongol khan, came to power in Persia, to the death in 1405 of Timur, founder of the Timurid line. This period is central to the history of the region as a time of important social and political transitions. The work recounts how the Mongol khanates disintegrated, various local Mongol and non-Mongol lineages competed for supremacy, and the Timurid lineage established itself as the dominant political and social group. This volume describes Timur, his rise to power, and his immediate descendants. Timur was succeeded by his son Shahrukh, under whom Razzaq prospered as a legal courtier, trustee, and ambassador. Razzaq's ambassadorial missions took him to various places in Eurasia, for example to Calicut in the southwest of India in 1442. The major figures and events described in volume one of Razzaq's work are also described in other contemporary texts. Volume two recounts the reigns of Shahrukh and his descendants, and covers the accession to the throne of Sultan Ḥusain Bāyqarā Chorasan and other events to which the author was eyewitness. The descriptive preface praises God, Muhammad, and the four guided caliphs in Islam. It explains that Razzaq long had wanted to write a history but was prevented from doing so by political instability and other problems. However, one year at Nowruz (New Year) his old friend Shikh Maza al-Din Husain encouraged him to finish writing his text. The events are described chronologically, using the Islamic calendar. The title of each event, verses from Qur'an, and poems all are rubricated. Events usually start with one of the following phrases: \"mention of,\" \"the event of,\" and \"sending of.\" Pages are numbered but numbers do not show on some early pages because of water damage; folio 11 is missing.

He introduced reforms that improved the lives of his subjects and cultivated new commercial and diplomatic relations with the European powers. Persian artistic achievement also reached its high point during his reign, as carpet weaving, ceramics, painting, and the production of illuminated manuscripts all flourished under his patronage.

                "Manuscript is incomplete; text breaks off abruptly at second word of line 5, leaf 257a. Tārīkh-i Nādirī (The history of Nadir) is a historical work that chronicles the political and military career of Nadir Shah, who was born in 1688 and rose to power in Iran during the 1720s; he became shah in 1736. (This work is also known as Jahāngushāy-i Nādirī in reference to the celebrated history of Genghis Khan, whom Nadir Shah admired.) Nadir Shah is known as a military warrior famous for his campaigns in Iran, Afghanistan, northern India, and Central Asia. He was assassinated by his officers in June 1747. The name of the author of this work, Muhammad Mahdi Munshi' ibn Muhammad Nasir (also seen as Mahdi Khan Astarabadi), appears on page four. Mahdi Khan was a court secretary, historian, and close confidante of Nadir Shah, whom he accompanied on many of his campaigns, so the work is an important historical source. The manuscript is organized chronologically and recounts about 100 military and political events. The preliminary pages contain a preface outlining the political developments in Iran and Qandahar (or Kandahar) that led to the Afghan invasion of Persia in 1722 and the emergence of Nadir Shah as a ruler who would confront and eventually defeat the Afghans and other enemies. The manuscript is incomplete, with the scribe having stopped mid-sentence after completing several lines from the penultimate section of the work, \"On the end of the [Nadir Shah] and the manner of his murder...\". Virtually all of this penultimate section (chronicling the cruel and bloody final years of Nadir's reign) and the final section (on the rule of ʻAli Quli Khan and Ibrahim Khan, nephews of Nadir, who each claimed the throne for a brief period after the assassination of their uncle) are therefore missing from the manuscript. The missing parts correspond roughly to six pages of text. In the manner typical of Persian court historiography, the author emphasizes throughout the restoration of order, the introduction of justice, and the defeat of the enemies of the state. Various poems and verses from the Qur'an appear throughout the text. The manuscript is written by a single hand in a uniform nastaliq, the calligraphic Persian script. All of the events recounted have a rubricated title. The first word of every other page is repeated as a \"catchword\" in the bottom margin of the previous page to ensure the proper order of the pages prior to binding, as was common practice in Persia and elsewhere.

                  "Tārīkh-i Nādirī (The history of Nadir) is a historical work that chronicles the political and military career of Nadir Shah, who was born in 1688 and rose to power in Iran during the 1720s; he became shah in 1736. (This work is also known as Jahāngushāy-i Nādirī in reference to the celebrated history of Genghis Khan, whom Nadir Shah admired.) Nadir Shah is known as a military warrior famous for his campaigns in Iran, Afghanistan, northern India, and Central Asia. He was assassinated by his officers in June 1747. The name of the author of this work, Muhammad Mahdi Munshi' ibn Muhammad Nasir (also seen as Mahdi Khan Astarabadi), appears on page four. Mahdi Khan was a court secretary, historian, and close confidante of Nadir Shah, whom he accompanied on many of his campaigns, so the work is an important historical source. The manuscript is organized chronologically and recounts about 100 military and political events. The preliminary pages contain a preface outlining the political developments in Iran and Qandahar (or Kandahar) that led to the Afghan invasion of Persia in 1722 and the emergence of Nadir Shah as a ruler who would confront and eventually defeat the Afghans and other enemies. The manuscript is incomplete, with the scribe having stopped mid-sentence after completing several lines from the penultimate section of the work, \"On the end of the [Nadir Shah] and the manner of his murder...\". Virtually all of this penultimate section (chronicling the cruel and bloody final years of Nadir's reign) and the final section (on the rule of ʻAli Quli Khan and Ibrahim Khan, nephews of Nadir, who each claimed the throne for a brief period after the assassination of their uncle) are therefore missing from the manuscript. The missing parts correspond roughly to six pages of text. In the manner typical of Persian court historiography, the author emphasizes throughout the restoration of order, the introduction of justice, and the defeat of the enemies of the state. Various poems and verses from the Qur'an appear throughout the text. The manuscript is written by a single hand in a uniform nastaliq, the calligraphic Persian script. All of the events recounted have a rubricated title. The first word of every other page is repeated as a \"catchword\" in the bottom margin of the previous page to ensure the proper order of the pages prior to binding, as was common practice in Persia and elsewhere.

                "Historical study of Iran during the Qajar dynasty in 19th century and of Afghanistan during the rules of Shīr ʻAlī Khān, ʻAbdurraḥmān K̲h̲ān̲ and Ḥabīb Allāh Khān. Kullīyāt-i Riyāz̤ī (Riyazi's book, usually known in English as the Collected Works of Ryazi) is a literary-historical work written in a mixture of prose and verse styles and published in a lithographic version in Mashhad, Iran, in 1906. It chronicles social, cultural, and political events taking place in the second-half of the 19th century in Afghanistan and Persia, especially during the reigns of Afghan ruler ʻAbd al-Rahman Khan (1880-1901) and his Persian counterpart, Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar (1896-1907). The author, Muhammad Yusuf Riyazi Haravi, was from a family of bureaucrats; his father had served different local Afghan officials in Herat. Historians generally have used colonial sources in their study of late-19th century Iran and Afghanistan; this book is a local historical source for the study of relations between these two countries and their formation. Muhammad Yusuf received support from Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar, who is praised as a just and learned ruler. The author also provides rich descriptions of his own family background, childhood education, travels, and his move to Qajar Iran and the confiscation of his and his family's property in Herat. The book includes a preface, table of contents, 12 chapters, and an extra section. The preface contains a 48-line verse and a prose section praising God, Muhammad, the family of ʻAli, the Qajar dynasts, and the author's own family. Chapter 1 describes the family background of the author. Chapter 2 contains several hikayat (stories) describing cities, political regions, and individuals; this chapter also includes a section on Afghanistan. Chapter 3, the longest, documents events in late-19th century Afghanistan and elsewhere, such as the signing of a friendship treaty between China and Japan, the death of a prime minister in the Ottoman Empire, and the Greek-Ottoman Wars. Chapter 4, called \"Book of Knowledge,\" discusses \"12 types of knowledge.\" Chapter 5, entitled \"Questions and Answers,\" describes ten encounters with different individuals in which various topics are discussed, for example, with a German traveler about religious laws in Islamic countries, and with an English officer about why Muslims do not send their children to Europe for schooling. Chapter 6 contains spiritual ghazal (lyric poems). Chapter 7, \"The Source of Crying,\" also has spiritual poems. Chapter 8 contains quintet poems, here called takhmisat. Chapter 9 is only one page and appears to be incomplete; it contains a few quintet and quatrain poems. Chapter 10, \"Book of Regrets,\" discusses 12 different topics, for example, the finite character of the world and the nature of worship. Chapter 11, \"Situations of Cities and Countries,\" is a brief ethnographic account of Beijing, Kabul, Mashhad, and other places. Chapter 12 offers a conclusion; it also describes the recently concluded Russo-Japanese War (1904-5). The book ends with a section, Mulh'qat (Relevancies), which covers a seemingly random set of topics, including a hunting campaign in 1904 of Amir Habibullah Khan, nationalist activities in Greece, and the salaries of poets in Herat. This work clearly was written at different times and published by the author as single collection. Each chapter forms a unit, and there are no direct connections between them. The book contains lithographic images, including of the Qajar and Afghan rulers and of the author. World Digital Library."

                  "Historical study of Iran during the Qajar dynasty in 19th century and of Afghanistan during the rules of Shīr ʻAlī Khān, ʻAbdurraḥmān K̲h̲ān̲ and Ḥabīb Allāh Khān.",
                  "Kullīyāt-i Riyāz̤ī (Riyazi's book, usually known in English as the Collected Works of Ryazi) is a literary-historical work written in a mixture of prose and verse styles and published in a lithographic version in Mashhad, Iran, in 1906. It chronicles social, cultural, and political events taking place in the second-half of the 19th century in Afghanistan and Persia, especially during the reigns of Afghan ruler ʻAbd al-Rahman Khan (1880-1901) and his Persian counterpart, Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar (1896-1907). The author, Muhammad Yusuf Riyazi Haravi, was from a family of bureaucrats; his father had served different local Afghan officials in Herat. Historians generally have used colonial sources in their study of late-19th century Iran and Afghanistan; this book is a local historical source for the study of relations between these two countries and their formation. Muhammad Yusuf received support from Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar, who is praised as a just and learned ruler. The author also provides rich descriptions of his own family background, childhood education, travels, and his move to Qajar Iran and the confiscation of his and his family's property in Herat. The book includes a preface, table of contents, 12 chapters, and an extra section. The preface contains a 48-line verse and a prose section praising God, Muhammad, the family of ʻAli, the Qajar dynasts, and the author's own family. Chapter 1 describes the family background of the author. Chapter 2 contains several hikayat (stories) describing cities, political regions, and individuals; this chapter also includes a section on Afghanistan. Chapter 3, the longest, documents events in late-19th century Afghanistan and elsewhere, such as the signing of a friendship treaty between China and Japan, the death of a prime minister in the Ottoman Empire, and the Greek-Ottoman Wars. Chapter 4, called \"Book of Knowledge,\" discusses \"12 types of knowledge.\" Chapter 5, entitled \"Questions and Answers,\" describes ten encounters with different individuals in which various topics are discussed, for example, with a German traveler about religious laws in Islamic countries, and with an English officer about why Muslims do not send their children to Europe for schooling. Chapter 6 contains spiritual ghazal (lyric poems). Chapter 7, \"The Source of Crying,\" also has spiritual poems. Chapter 8 contains quintet poems, here called takhmisat. Chapter 9 is only one page and appears to be incomplete; it contains a few quintet and quatrain poems. Chapter 10, \"Book of Regrets,\" discusses 12 different topics, for example, the finite character of the world and the nature of worship. Chapter 11, \"Situations of Cities and Countries,\" is a brief ethnographic account of Beijing, Kabul, Mashhad, and other places. Chapter 12 offers a conclusion; it also describes the recently concluded Russo-Japanese War (1904-5). The book ends with a section, Mulh'qat (Relevancies), which covers a seemingly random set of topics, including a hunting campaign in 1904 of Amir Habibullah Khan, nationalist activities in Greece, and the salaries of poets in Herat. This work clearly was written at different times and published by the author as single collection. Each chapter forms a unit, and there are no direct connections between them. The book contains lithographic images, including of the Qajar and Afghan rulers and of the author. World Digital Library."

                "Tavarikh-i Khurshid-i Jahan (literally, Histories of the sun of the world) is primarily a history of Afghan Pushtun (or Pashtun) ancestry. It describes Afghan Pushtun genealogies, the various lineages, and the many political events, wars, and polities, such as the Safavid and Mughal dynasties in Khorasan and India, with which the Pushtuns have historically been identified. The book is arranged in four sections. Section one is a detailed list of contents. Section two begins with a preface containing the names of the author, patron, and contributor and proclaims that the work is \"to be a book of history of Afghan Pushtun ancestry since the creation of Adam.\" This section covers the various popular genealogical legends of the Afghan Pushtuns, chief among them that they are descendants of one of the tribes of Israelites, specifically children of Saul, the first king of Israel. Section three is the main text and has eight chapters devoted to the history of the Pushtuns. An epilogue, written both in prose and verse, gives the author's name, publication details, and a brief conclusion of the contents of the book. Tables charting the various genealogies of Afghan Pushtuns with detailed introductions to each lineage appear in several chapters. For example, tables outlining the descent of the Barakzais, Alokzais, Mohmands, Kakars, and other families appear on pages 188-319. These genealogical tables are followed by detailed discussions. The book was published in 1894 in Lahore (present-day Pakistan). The full name of the author, Sher Muḥammad Khān Saheb Gandapur Ibrahim Zai (circa 1837-1902), appears on the cover of the book. He most likely was a Gandapur Pushtun and an official appointed by the British in the municipality of Kulachi in Dera Ismail Khan, one of the administrative centers in the Northwest Frontier Province of British India. The preface says that he had written another historical work called Gulshan-i Afghanistan (Flower garden of Afghanistan), published under the title Hayat-i Afghani (Ancestry of the Afghans). Sher Muḥammad Khān claims that Hayat-i Afghani fell into the hands of Mohammad Hayat Khan Saheb, a judicial official in Bannu District of the province, who published it under his own name; the veracity of this claim has not been proven. It is clear, however, that Tavarīkh-i Khurshid-i Jahan was published under the patronage of Sardar Mohammad Hayat Khan Saheb, who could possibly have been the same official. The 319 pages of the work are numbered with Indo-Arabic numerals. World Digital Library."

                "Historical study of the Afghan rulers from the beginning of Islam. Tārīkh-i Sulṭānī (The Sulṭānī history) is a historical study of the Afghan people and the rulers of Afghanistan from the beginnings of Islam to the mid-19th century. The work was published as a lithographic print in Bombay (present-day Mumbai) in 1881. This copy has been rebound, with \"Ṣaḥāfī Sulṭān Muḥammad, Kabul\" gold-stamped on the back cover. The title page and pages 3-4 are damaged and repaired with no loss of text. The last page (page 291) has been repaired and missing text added in ink in a later hand. Lithographic printing was invented in Europe in the late-18th century and spread widely on the Indian subcontinent from the early 19th century onward, its popularity stemming from the relative ease with which it could be used to reproduce different scripts not based on the Latin alphabet.

        "Ẓuhūr al-amān (The advent of security) is a book on civics published during the reign of Ammanullah Khan (1919-29) as amir of Afghanistan. The book's title pays homage to the name of Ammanullah Khan himself. In its treatment of the duties of the members of Afghan society to the ruler and to each other, Ẓuhūr al-amān appears to highlight the challenges faced by Ammanullah Khan in his efforts to modernize Afghanistan. The book is divided into more than 30 short chapters describing the rights and responsibilities of the ruler, of persons living within a family unit, and of members of Afghan society as a whole. Some sections, such as one on the rights that are to be afforded to the king (ḥuquq-i lazima bar padishah), are further divided into subsections. The book begins with several chapters on religious matters, including those on tauhid (the unity of God), on ʻibada (worship), and on fahm-i sharīʻat-i rasūl ʻalayhi al-salām (the sharia). Ẓuhūr al-amān was published on October 11, 1923, by the then newly established Ministry of Education. The author of the work, a religious scholar by the name of ʻAbd al-Haqq, lists his father as ʻAbd al-ʻAziz from the village of Lower Arghanda in the township of Paghman, near Kabul.  He highlights, as well, his tribal affiliation with the well-known Pushtun tribe of Suleimankhel. World Digital Library."

        "Commentary and explanation of some Qurʼānic verses. Kashf al-asrār (The unveiling of mysteries) is a book of Qur'anic commentary dating from the early 20th century. The author, Shir Ahmad, was from Kabul, Afghanistan. In the Kashf al-asrār, Shir Ahmad makes repeated reference to an earlier and more comprehensive commentary but states that, because of the great bulk of the earlier work, he was forced to write a short text dealing with various essential topics. The Kashf al-asrār is organized as an introduction and 13 sections, with each section treating a collection of related verses from the Qur'an. Shir Ahmad writes the introduction in Persian, in which he makes a customary plea about the potential shortcomings of his work. In the subsequent section the commentary is in Arabic. The Qur'anic verses under consideration are written in the same color and in the same naskh calligraphy as the commentary, but they are set off by use of a larger script size. Somewhat unexpectedly, Shir Ahmad switches back to a Persian commentary (written in the nasta'liq calligraphic style) mid-way through the subsequent section. The work concludes with a table of contents. Shir Ahmad's Kashf al-asrār shares its name with a number of works, including a celebrated 12th century Qur'anic commentary by Rashid al-Din Maybudi. The book was printed and published in 1910 or 1911 in Kabul by Matbaʻah-i ʻUmumi. World Digital Library."

        "On recitation and reading of the Qurʼān. This work is an introduction to the rules of pronunciation during the recitation of the Qur'an. It was written for students at the elementary and intermediate levels in Afghanistan. In the preface the author states that in teaching the rules of proper pronunciation, the focus should be on skills that young Persian- or Pushto-speaking students have not been exposed to, e.g., the proper pronunciation of letters in Arabic, mudd (prolongation), awqaf (pause), and other topics. The book begins with a list of makharij (emission points) for the letters. These are listed as 17 locations in the throat, tongue, lips, nose, and mouth. The conventions for sounding the letters are divided into various categories. For the letter nun (n) the following cases are listed: izhar (clarity, i.e., the clear pronunciation of the letter if it is following by \"letters of the throat\" such as the ʻayin); idgham (merging, i.e., of two consecutive words, when the first word ends in a nun, and the second word is followed by ra', r, or lam, l); iqlab (conversion, i.e., the conversion of the nun to a mim, m, if it is followed by a ba', b); and ikhfa' (concealment, which covers the remaining cases for the letter nun, and is accompanied by a ghunnah, or nasalization). A previous owner has added occasional corrections to the text. The work was published in the year 1300 AH of the solar Islamic calendar, corresponding to 1921 or 1922. This anonymously written work was printed at the Ministry of Education Press in Kabul, under the auspices of Muhammad Sulayman Khan, who served as minister of education under Amanullah Khan (reigned 1919-29).

        "Risālah-i Puṣhto It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr (On the obedience of the ruler in Pashto) is a tract meant to encourage obedience to the ruler of Afghanistan. The expression ūlā al-amr refers to one who is foremost in authority, and the title of the book references a Qur'anic verse (5:59), \"Oh Believers! Obey the Lord and the Prophet and those who are foremost in authority amongst you,\" which is quoted at the beginning of the work. Numerous quotes from the hadith literature (primarily from the collection of al-Bukhari) follow. The Arabic text of each hadith is followed by an explanation in Pashto, several of which equate disobedience with jahāla (ignorance, i.e. of religious precepts) and contrast it with shahāda (bearing testimony or witness to Islam). The aim of the work is thus plainly the garnering of legitimacy and authority for the then-ruling Afghan emir, Habibullah Khan (reigned 1901-19). The Persian original of this work was composed by Maulawi ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan (1878 or 1879-1919), who, ironically, appears to have been jailed for his involvement in the constitutional movement in the early 1900s against the authoritarianism of Habibullah Khan. By the time he composed the It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr, ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan was serving Habibullah Khan in the role of mullā-i darbār (court theologian). Both ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan and the translator, Salih Muhammad, were teachers at the Habibiya School founded by Habibullah Khan. The Pashto translation of It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr was printed by the Dar al-Saltanah press in Kabul. The cover states that it is the first Pashto work printed in Afghanistan, and that it was meant to be distributed free of charge. World Digital Library."

          "Risālah-i Puṣhto It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr (On the obedience of the ruler in Pashto) is a tract meant to encourage obedience to the ruler of Afghanistan. The expression ūlā al-amr refers to one who is foremost in authority, and the title of the book references a Qur'anic verse (5:59), \"Oh Believers! Obey the Lord and the Prophet and those who are foremost in authority amongst you,\" which is quoted at the beginning of the work. Numerous quotes from the hadith literature (primarily from the collection of al-Bukhari) follow. The Arabic text of each hadith is followed by an explanation in Pashto, several of which equate disobedience with jahāla (ignorance, i.e. of religious precepts) and contrast it with shahāda (bearing testimony or witness to Islam). The aim of the work is thus plainly the garnering of legitimacy and authority for the then-ruling Afghan emir, Habibullah Khan (reigned 1901-19). The Persian original of this work was composed by Maulawi ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan (1878 or 1879-1919), who, ironically, appears to have been jailed for his involvement in the constitutional movement in the early 1900s against the authoritarianism of Habibullah Khan. By the time he composed the It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr, ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan was serving Habibullah Khan in the role of mullā-i darbār (court theologian). Both ʻAbd al-Rabb Khan and the translator, Salih Muhammad, were teachers at the Habibiya School founded by Habibullah Khan. The Pashto translation of It̤āʻat-i ūlā al-amr was printed by the Dar al-Saltanah press in Kabul. The cover states that it is the first Pashto work printed in Afghanistan, and that it was meant to be distributed free of charge. World Digital Library."

        "Tuḥfat al-ʻulamā' (An offering for religious scholars) is ostensibly a tract addressed to the ʻulamā' (religious scholars) of Afghanistan, asking them to actively discourage the suspicion held by their followers toward things foreign. It was written by order of the Afghan ruler Sher Ali Khan (reigned 1863-66 and 1868-79). Little is known of the author, ʻAbd al-Qadir Khan, although he is identified as a qāḍī (judge) indicating his religious authority. ʻAbd al-Qadir uses numerous quotations from the hadith literature to argue that practices originating with \"non-believers\" may be in accordance with the sharia provided these practices benefit the Islamic ummah (community). The foreign practices in question mostly have to do with the military--that military spending and a strong military are consistent with Islamic teachings remain major themes throughout the work. Although the heavy reliance on the Qur'an, the hadith, and quotations by learned men in the Islamic tradition (such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and Muhammad al-Ghazali) demonstrate the expertise and the erudition of the author (or, possibly, authors), the polemical and often repetitious arguments serve to emphasize the purely propagandistic aspects of Tuḥfat al-ʻulamā'. The timing of the publication is noteworthy. For much of his career Sher Ali Khan was in the enviable position of managing the conflicting interests of tsarist Russia and Great Britain, two colonial powers locked in the \"Great Game\" for mastery over Afghanistan. The publication of Tuḥfat al-ʻulamā' in 1875 predates the Second Anglo-Afghan War (and Sher Ali's retreat from Kabul) by several years. The book was published in the Mustafawi printing press, which was founded by Sher Ali Khan, and is one of the earliest works printed in Afghanistan. World Digital Library."

        "Written in India by an unknown author in the final decades of the 19th century, Ghāyat al-shuʻūr bi-ḥujaj al-ḥajj al-mabrūr (The utmost knowledge of the arguments for the blessed Hajj) describes the various observances associated with the Hajj pilgrimage. The introduction and the text are written in Arabic, but the main text is in Persian, as are two appended texts (by a different author), a taqriz (encomium) praising Ghāyat al-shuʻūr, and a shorter versified text directed against critics of the work. The main text is dedicated by the author to a nobleman by the name of Rahim al-Din. The afterword states that the work is a second edition, printed in 1290 AH (1873) by the famed Newal Kishore Press in Lucknow, the first edition having been printed in Calcutta in 1283 AH (1866-67). Inserted prior to the discussion of the publication date is a chronogram that stands for 1290 AH, i.e., the date of the second edition of the work. The chronogram is credited to a Sayyid Munawwar Husayn, an employee of the court of Awadh (also called Oudh). The nawabs of Awadh were a Persian Shiʻa dynasty that had migrated to India from Nishapur (in present-day Iran) and that actively promulgated Persian letters and Shiʻa beliefs. The Nawabate of Awadh was stripped of power, however, by the British in the aftermath of the Uprising of 1857 (also known as the Sepoy Rebellion), roughly a decade before Ghāyat al-shuʻūr was first published. The mention of the court of Awadh is therefore somewhat anachronistic--a reference to what was by then at best a ceremonial office. World Digital Library."

          "Written in India by an unknown author in the final decades of the 19th century, Ghāyat al-shuʻūr bi-ḥujaj al-ḥajj al-mabrūr (The utmost knowledge of the arguments for the blessed Hajj) describes the various observances associated with the Hajj pilgrimage. The introduction and the text are written in Arabic, but the main text is in Persian, as are two appended texts (by a different author), a taqriz (encomium) praising Ghāyat al-shuʻūr, and a shorter versified text directed against critics of the work. The main text is dedicated by the author to a nobleman by the name of Rahim al-Din. The afterword states that the work is a second edition, printed in 1290 AH (1873) by the famed Newal Kishore Press in Lucknow, the first edition having been printed in Calcutta in 1283 AH (1866-67). Inserted prior to the discussion of the publication date is a chronogram that stands for 1290 AH, i.e., the date of the second edition of the work. The chronogram is credited to a Sayyid Munawwar Husayn, an employee of the court of Awadh (also called Oudh). The nawabs of Awadh were a Persian Shiʻa dynasty that had migrated to India from Nishapur (in present-day Iran) and that actively promulgated Persian letters and Shiʻa beliefs. The Nawabate of Awadh was stripped of power, however, by the British in the aftermath of the Uprising of 1857 (also known as the Sepoy Rebellion), roughly a decade before Ghāyat al-shuʻūr was first published. The mention of the court of Awadh is therefore somewhat anachronistic--a reference to what was by then at best a ceremonial office. World Digital Library."

        "This manuscript in Persian is an untitled Sufi text on meditation containing both poetry and prose. It was completed in early 1520, probably in Herat (present-day Afghanistan) or Mashhad (present-day Iran). The colophon, which is in Arabic, gives the name of the scribe, Mīr 'Alī Ḥusaynī Haravī (circa 1476-1543). The manuscript is on a firm cream-colored paper inlaid into light cream (folios 1-8) or pale greenish-blue margin paper, with the writing enclosed within alternating gold and cream (or green) bands with black ruling. The margin paper is profusely decorated with floral and animal motifs. The text is in nastalīq script, eight lines to the page. The binding is contemporary leather with medallions. A former owner's stamp appears on folio 1a. Sufism, a mystical and introspective interpretation of Islam that emerged after the initial spread of the religion, combines Islamic teachings with gnosticism. The practice embraced the idea of enlightenment through spiritual knowledge, informed by pre-Islamic Greek, Zoroastrian, and Indian spiritual practices. By the 13th century, Sufi thought in the Persian-speaking world was expressed primarily through poetry or in poetic works of prose, such as this treatise. World Digital Library. Untitled Sufi text on meditation containing both poetry and prose."

        "Shiite prayer book; consists of prayers to be said on the visitation of Caliph ʻAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib's tomb. This manuscript of Durrat al-tāj (The crown jewel) is a Shiite prayer book, consisting of prayers to be said when making a visitation to the tomb of Caliph ʻAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61). 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. The manuscript was probably written in Iran, possibly in the 17th century. The paper is of a thick, cream-colored polished Middle Eastern style, without distinctive chain or laid lines, and no watermark. The text is written in black ink in naskhī script, nine lines on each page, with gold decorations between lines. The borders of the written area are lined with black ink, with profuse decoration outside of the written area. The text is rubricated. The title was added by a later hand. There is no colophon. The binding is referred to as chahargusheh, meaning a frame binding made around a Kashmiri shawl dating from the first half of the 1700s (circa 1740s). World Digital Library."

          "This manuscript of Durrat al-tāj (The crown jewel) is a Shiite prayer book, consisting of prayers to be said when making a visitation to the tomb of Caliph ʻAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61). 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. The manuscript was probably written in Iran, possibly in the 17th century. The paper is of a thick, cream-colored polished Middle Eastern style, without distinctive chain or laid lines, and no watermark. The text is written in black ink in naskhī script, nine lines on each page, with gold decorations between lines. The borders of the written area are lined with black ink, with profuse decoration outside of the written area. The text is rubricated. The title was added by a later hand. There is no colophon. The binding is referred to as chahargusheh, meaning a frame binding made around a Kashmiri shawl dating from the first half of the 1700s (circa 1740s). World Digital Library."

        "Caliph 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61) is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. Shown here is an illuminated 18th-century manuscript copy of the Munājāt (Supplication) of ʻAli ibn Abī Ṭālib. Included are both the original Arabic and a translation into Persian. The text is written on a moderately heavy cream-colored paper in gold (folio 1b and 2a) and black ink (folio 2b to the end) within five borders. The borders are colored in, from the outermost to the innermost, in blue, red, gold, red, and green. The pages are divided into four boxes to accommodate the main text and the translation, three containing two lines and one containing one line, or seven lines for each page. The Arabic text, in naskhi script, is in larger boxes with elaborate interlinear decoration; the Persian translation, in nastaʻlīq script, is in narrower boxes with panels of floral decoration on either side. An unknown Persian text appears on folio 1a, part of which is missing along the left margin due to trimming and on the upper-right margin due to damage to the first folio (mended with some loss of this text but no damage to main text). The name and date \"Vahīd Ḥusaynī 1209\" (1794 or 1795) appears at the lower-left corner of the written area of folio 7b; an unknown Persian text in a later hand appears on the endpaper.

          "Caliph 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib (circa 601-61) is one of the most revered religious and holy figures of Islam. In Iran, he is referred to by the honorary name Amir al-Muʼminin, which translates from Arabic as “Commander of the Faithful” and is used to refer to him in Persian. Written works by 'Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and sayings attributed to him are sacred to the Shiite faithful, particularly among Persian speakers. Shown here is an illuminated 18th-century manuscript copy of the Munājāt (Supplication) of ʻAli ibn Abī Ṭālib. Included are both the original Arabic and a translation into Persian. The text is written on a moderately heavy cream-colored paper in gold (folio 1b and 2a) and black ink (folio 2b to the end) within five borders. The borders are colored in, from the outermost to the innermost, in blue, red, gold, red, and green. The pages are divided into four boxes to accommodate the main text and the translation, three containing two lines and one containing one line, or seven lines for each page. The Arabic text, in naskhi script, is in larger boxes with elaborate interlinear decoration; the Persian translation, in nastaʻlīq script, is in narrower boxes with panels of floral decoration on either side. An unknown Persian text appears on folio 1a, part of which is missing along the left margin due to trimming and on the upper-right margin due to damage to the first folio (mended with some loss of this text but no damage to main text). The name and date \"Vahīd Ḥusaynī 1209\" (1794 or 1795) appears at the lower-left corner of the written area of folio 7b; an unknown Persian text in a later hand appears on the endpaper.

        "Memoirs of the author on the socio-political history of Tajikistan during early 20th century. Yāddāsht-i yak musāfir (Memoirs of a traveler) is an account of the political and social history of the Tajikistan in the early 20th century, written from a pro-Soviet and pro-Russian perspective. The author, Fazl Ahmad Afghan, writes of leaving Afghanistan for neighboring Tajikistan near the turn of the century and records his observations about the remarkable progress made by the Tajik people in subsequent decades. He begins his history with the Emirate of Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan) on the eve of its annexation by imperial Russia in the 1860s and 1870s. The author emphasizes the backward character of this polity (placing special emphasis on the licentiousness of the clergy) and the hopeless plight of those living within its borders. Annexation by Russia brings some improvement in the form of the telegraph and postal service and other symbols of progress, but these changes only benefit the ruling class, leaving the working class to languish as before. The main portion of the book offers a glowing (and one-sided) account of the progress achieved in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution and the formation of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. Areas of progress in the author's view include improved health care and education, equality for women, and an equitable system of control over the agricultural and industrial production by the working class. A notable feature of the early history of the Tajik Republic is that it was initially formed as an entity within the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Writing in the mid-1930s, the author treats the secession of the Tajik Republic from the Uzbek Republic, which occurred in 1929, as not yet fully actualized. Several of the illustrations in the book depict public buildings said to serve the working class in the post-revolutionary period. The section on the period of imperial Russian rule includes an illustration of revolutionary Tajiks condemned to die for their seditious activities, while the section on the rule of the Emirate of Bukhara includes an illustration of an anonymous and fictitious victim of torture. The final chapter concerns the history of contemporary Afghanistan, but virtually all of the text for this section is missing. The final surviving portion of the book is a condemnation of British capitalism and its exploitation of Egypt, Iran, and Afghanistan, and a presentation of the argument that were these nations to be freed of foreign influence, they could share in the progress made by the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic.

        "Historical study of Bukhoro, Uzbekistan written by the Amir of Bokhara. This work is a history of Bukhara (in present-day Uzbekistan), written by Said Mir Mohammed Alim Khan (1880-1944), the last amir of Bukhara. Between 1785 and 1920 Bukhara was ruled by eight amirs of the Manghit dynasty. After the Russian conquest of Samarkand in 1868, the emirate of Bukhara became a Russian protectorate. Alim Khan assumed power in 1910, following the death of his father, Abdulahad Khan. Alim Khan was overthrown by the Red Army in September 1920, went into exile, and eventually settled in Kabul, Afghanistan. The title of the book, The Anguish of Nations, alludes to the suffering of his people under communist rule. The text, in Persian, is dated 1921, but the book contains a map of Bukhara and its border with Afghanistan, in French and with information about events after 1925. The illustrations include several photographs of the amir. World Digital Library."

        "Extensive historical study of Amir Timur's conquests of Afghan and Iranian cities. Kulliyat-e Farsi Taymurnamah (literally, The biographical account of Timur) is a biography of Timur or Tamerlane (1336-1405), the Turkic-Mongolian founder of the Timurid dynasty and lineage. It chronicles in detail his personal, political, and military life, including campaigns and conquests, and events in the regions of present-day Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Iran. Many biographies of Timur were produced during his lifetime and after. This lithographed version was published in Tashkent by Matba-e Ghulam Hasan in 1912. The last page of the introduction (pages 2-7) states that this book was written in 1792 during the reign of Shah Murad, founder of the emirate of Bukhara. The full name of the author, Mirza Muhamamd Qasim Ibn Abdul Khaliq Bukhari, appears on the cover, but no other information about him is provided. The introduction to this copy is a typical Persian historiographical trope praising God's supremacy and linking the rise of a ruler, Timur, to divine sanction. The author emphasizes that this connection also held true with the prophets, from Abraham to Muhammad, and for the first four caliphs of Islam, Abu Bakr, Umar, Usman, and Ali. On page four the author states that \"humanity\" is of two types, firstly the prophets, then the kings, as protectors of religion, makers and keepers of peace, and defenders of justice with courage and bravery. (He says nothing about people who do not fit either of these categories.) Timur (Amir Timur Gorgan) is seen as the latter type, \"unquestionably brave, and conqueror of the world from Bulgaria to China, and the ruler of Iran and Turan.\" The author refers to other biographers of Timur, including Qazi Abdul Wakil and Abdul Razzaq Samarqandi. He covers Timur's family background, coronation as a ruler in Balkh in 1369-70, and his military campaigns. The work also expands beyond the life of Timur to cover events relating to the lives of his descendants, including the coronation of Mirza Shahrukh as a dynast in Herat, the rise of Babur as emperor in Khorasan and India, and the emergence of the Uzbeks and Safavids as new political lineages in Mawaranahr, Khorasan, and Iran. Particular historical events, individual figures, and narratives are marked with bold subheadings within the text and above. The first dastan (narrative) on pages eight to 15 concerns the birth of Timur. The last dastan is on his death and briefly discusses his descendants, notably his 34 sons and his many grandchildren. Notes and the signatures of anonymous readers, or perhaps of the author, appear in the margins of the text, as well as seals and stamps of many other readers on the last page of the book. The work is about 440 pages, paginated with Indo-Arabic numerals. World Digital Library."

        "Memoirs of Timur originally written in Chagatay, now lost, translated into Persian by the Mughal scholar Abū Ṭālib al-Ḥusaynī. The 14th-century Turkic-Mongol ruler Timur (Tamerlane) wrote a memoir in Chagatai Turkish, the original of which is now lost. The work was intended as a book of advice for princes and rulers and has been given various titles over the years, including, as in this manuscript, Malfūẓāt (Utterances). The memoir was translated into Persian by Abu Talib al-Husayni, who appears to have been a Shia scholar-official from Khorasan in the service of the Mughal rulers in India in the 1630s. Al-Husayni discovered a Turkish version of the manuscript in the library of an Ottoman governor in Yemen, which he used as the basis for his translation. Al-Husayni dedicated his translation to Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628-58), who apparently disliked it and demanded revisions, which were done by Muhammad Afzal Bakhtiyari. This copy of al-Husayni's translation was probably produced somewhere in India in the mid-19th century. The manuscript contains only one of the many versions of Timur's memoir to have been written and revised over the centuries. It begins with a preface (folios 1-4) in which Bakhtiyari offers a note of praise to God, Muhammad, the four Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and the Timurid sultans. The preface also contains the title of the manuscript; a brief mention of the story of its discovery, translation into Persian, and revision; and remarks on its usefulness for future princes and statesmen, along with a commentary on the childhood and kingly life of Timur. This is followed by a brief section entitled \"Divinely-Inspired Twelve Principles of Timur\" (folios 4-5). Among the 12 principles by which Timur was said to have been inspired are \"Just Rule,\" \"Differentiation between Truth and Falsehood,\" and \"Following God's Laws.\" The bulk of the manuscript (folios 5-653) covers events in the life of Timur. The narrative is in the first person, and begins with the appointment of the four viziers. Some of the events are titled with red subheadings, while others are not. A final section (folios 653-55) describes Timur being on the road to conquer China, the illness he contracts on the way, his wasiyat (will), and death. The manuscript is written in thick nastaʻliq script, although not in one hand, indicating that it was copied by one or more persons at different times. Turkish Chagatai quotations with Persian translations appear in various places in the text. Pagination is in Arabic numerals. There are numerous repetitions, tautologies, and obscurities throughout the text, reflecting the influence of the many official and unofficial biographies and memoirs of Timur that have been copied and recopied into various languages over the centuries by different individuals and for different purposes. These \"Books of Timur,\" of different genres and titles, were patronized and popularized mainly by Mughal rulers of India in the 17th and 18th centuries. World Digital Library."

        "Jaz̲b al-qulūb ilá diyār al-maḥbūb (The attraction of hearts to the house of the beloved) by ʻAbd al-Haqq ibn Sayf al-Din Dihlavi (1551-1642) is a work in 17 chapters on the history and lore of the city of Medina. Surpassed only by Mecca in its importance to Muslims, Medina houses the tombs of the Prophet Muhammad and some of his close companions. The Hegira (or Hejira, the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina, then known as Yathrib) in 622 was a pivotal moment in Islamic history and serves as the origin of the Islamic calendar. In the introduction of the work, Sayf al-Din lists Wafā' al-wafā' bi akhbār dār al-muṣṭafā̄ (The exhaustive history of the house of the Chosen One) by Nur al-Din Abu al-Hasan al-Samhudi (1440-1506) as his main reference. He also states that he commenced writing his work during a visit to Medina in 998 AH (1589-90) and completed it in Delhi in 1001 AH (1592-93). Although Sayf al-Din discusses the customs involved in the pilgrimage to Medina, the focus for much of his work is on the physical fabric of the city and the architecture of its religious and secular spaces (much of which has fallen into decay or been subject to deliberate dismantling in the intervening centuries). The present volume is the third edition of this work, printed and published by the famed Newal Kishore Press in Lucknow, India, in 1914. World Digital Library. On Prophet Muḥammad, -632; and history of Medina, Saudi Arabia."

          "Jaz̲b al-qulūb ilá diyār al-maḥbūb (The attraction of hearts to the house of the beloved) by ʻAbd al-Haqq ibn Sayf al-Din Dihlavi (1551-1642) is a work in 17 chapters on the history and lore of the city of Medina. Surpassed only by Mecca in its importance to Muslims, Medina houses the tombs of the Prophet Muhammad and some of his close companions. The Hegira (or Hejira, the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina, then known as Yathrib) in 622 was a pivotal moment in Islamic history and serves as the origin of the Islamic calendar. In the introduction of the work, Sayf al-Din lists Wafā' al-wafā' bi akhbār dār al-muṣṭafā̄ (The exhaustive history of the house of the Chosen One) by Nur al-Din Abu al-Hasan al-Samhudi (1440-1506) as his main reference. He also states that he commenced writing his work during a visit to Medina in 998 AH (1589-90) and completed it in Delhi in 1001 AH (1592-93). Although Sayf al-Din discusses the customs involved in the pilgrimage to Medina, the focus for much of his work is on the physical fabric of the city and the architecture of its religious and secular spaces (much of which has fallen into decay or been subject to deliberate dismantling in the intervening centuries). The present volume is the third edition of this work, printed and published by the famed Newal Kishore Press in Lucknow, India, in 1914. World Digital Library.",

        "The first volume of a two volume work which in all covers 170 years. The first volume covers the years from the birth of the last Mongol ruler of Persia Abū Saʻīd (704/1304/5) until the death of Abū S aʻīd, the granson of Tīmūr (807/1405). This manuscript is volume one of Matla us-Sadain wa Majma ul-Baahrain (The rising of the propitious twin stars and the amalgamation of the oceans) by 'Abd al-Razzāq Kamāl al-Dīn ibn Isḥāq al-Samarqandī (1413-82). The book offers a semi-official account of the political history of the late Mongol khanates and Timurid polities in the Caucasus, Iran, Khorasan, and Mawarannahr. Volume one documents the period from 1316, when Abu Said Bahadur Khan, the last great Mongol khan, came to power in Persia, to the death in 1405 of Timur, founder of the Timurid line. This period is central to the history of the region as a time of important social and political transitions. The work recounts how the Mongol khanates disintegrated, various local Mongol and non-Mongol lineages competed for supremacy, and the Timurid lineage established itself as the dominant political and social group. This volume describes Timur, his rise to power, and his immediate descendants. Timur was succeeded by his son Shahrukh, under whom Razzaq prospered as a legal courtier, trustee, and ambassador. Razzaq's ambassadorial missions took him to various places in Eurasia, for example to Calicut in the southwest of India in 1442. The major figures and events described in volume one of Razzaq's work are also described in other contemporary texts. Volume two recounts the reigns of Shahrukh and his descendants, and covers the accession to the throne of Sultan Ḥusain Bāyqarā Chorasan and other events to which the author was eyewitness. The descriptive preface praises God, Muhammad, and the four guided caliphs in Islam. It explains that Razzaq long had wanted to write a history but was prevented from doing so by political instability and other problems. However, one year at Nowruz (New Year) his old friend Shikh Maza al-Din Husain encouraged him to finish writing his text. The events are described chronologically, using the Islamic calendar. The title of each event, verses from Qur'an, and poems all are rubricated. Events usually start with one of the following phrases: \"mention of,\" \"the event of,\" and \"sending of.\" Pages are numbered but numbers do not show on some early pages because of water damage; folio 11 is missing.

        "Manuscript is incomplete; text breaks off abruptly at second word of line 5, leaf 257a. Tārīkh-i Nādirī (The history of Nadir) is a historical work that chronicles the political and military career of Nadir Shah, who was born in 1688 and rose to power in Iran during the 1720s; he became shah in 1736. (This work is also known as Jahāngushāy-i Nādirī in reference to the celebrated history of Genghis Khan, whom Nadir Shah admired.) Nadir Shah is known as a military warrior famous for his campaigns in Iran, Afghanistan, northern India, and Central Asia. He was assassinated by his officers in June 1747. The name of the author of this work, Muhammad Mahdi Munshi' ibn Muhammad Nasir (also seen as Mahdi Khan Astarabadi), appears on page four. Mahdi Khan was a court secretary, historian, and close confidante of Nadir Shah, whom he accompanied on many of his campaigns, so the work is an important historical source. The manuscript is organized chronologically and recounts about 100 military and political events. The preliminary pages contain a preface outlining the political developments in Iran and Qandahar (or Kandahar) that led to the Afghan invasion of Persia in 1722 and the emergence of Nadir Shah as a ruler who would confront and eventually defeat the Afghans and other enemies. The manuscript is incomplete, with the scribe having stopped mid-sentence after completing several lines from the penultimate section of the work, \"On the end of the [Nadir Shah] and the manner of his murder...\". Virtually all of this penultimate section (chronicling the cruel and bloody final years of Nadir's reign) and the final section (on the rule of ʻAli Quli Khan and Ibrahim Khan, nephews of Nadir, who each claimed the throne for a brief period after the assassination of their uncle) are therefore missing from the manuscript. The missing parts correspond roughly to six pages of text. In the manner typical of Persian court historiography, the author emphasizes throughout the restoration of order, the introduction of justice, and the defeat of the enemies of the state. Various poems and verses from the Qur'an appear throughout the text. The manuscript is written by a single hand in a uniform nastaliq, the calligraphic Persian script. All of the events recounted have a rubricated title. The first word of every other page is repeated as a \"catchword\" in the bottom margin of the previous page to ensure the proper order of the pages prior to binding, as was common practice in Persia and elsewhere.

        "Historical study of Iran during the Qajar dynasty in 19th century and of Afghanistan during the rules of Shīr ʻAlī Khān, ʻAbdurraḥmān K̲h̲ān̲ and Ḥabīb Allāh Khān. Kullīyāt-i Riyāz̤ī (Riyazi's book, usually known in English as the Collected Works of Ryazi) is a literary-historical work written in a mixture of prose and verse styles and published in a lithographic version in Mashhad, Iran, in 1906. It chronicles social, cultural, and political events taking place in the second-half of the 19th century in Afghanistan and Persia, especially during the reigns of Afghan ruler ʻAbd al-Rahman Khan (1880-1901) and his Persian counterpart, Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar (1896-1907). The author, Muhammad Yusuf Riyazi Haravi, was from a family of bureaucrats; his father had served different local Afghan officials in Herat. Historians generally have used colonial sources in their study of late-19th century Iran and Afghanistan; this book is a local historical source for the study of relations between these two countries and their formation. Muhammad Yusuf received support from Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar, who is praised as a just and learned ruler. The author also provides rich descriptions of his own family background, childhood education, travels, and his move to Qajar Iran and the confiscation of his and his family's property in Herat. The book includes a preface, table of contents, 12 chapters, and an extra section. The preface contains a 48-line verse and a prose section praising God, Muhammad, the family of ʻAli, the Qajar dynasts, and the author's own family. Chapter 1 describes the family background of the author. Chapter 2 contains several hikayat (stories) describing cities, political regions, and individuals; this chapter also includes a section on Afghanistan. Chapter 3, the longest, documents events in late-19th century Afghanistan and elsewhere, such as the signing of a friendship treaty between China and Japan, the death of a prime minister in the Ottoman Empire, and the Greek-Ottoman Wars. Chapter 4, called \"Book of Knowledge,\" discusses \"12 types of knowledge.\" Chapter 5, entitled \"Questions and Answers,\" describes ten encounters with different individuals in which various topics are discussed, for example, with a German traveler about religious laws in Islamic countries, and with an English officer about why Muslims do not send their children to Europe for schooling. Chapter 6 contains spiritual ghazal (lyric poems). Chapter 7, \"The Source of Crying,\" also has spiritual poems. Chapter 8 contains quintet poems, here called takhmisat. Chapter 9 is only one page and appears to be incomplete; it contains a few quintet and quatrain poems. Chapter 10, \"Book of Regrets,\" discusses 12 different topics, for example, the finite character of the world and the nature of worship. Chapter 11, \"Situations of Cities and Countries,\" is a brief ethnographic account of Beijing, Kabul, Mashhad, and other places. Chapter 12 offers a conclusion; it also describes the recently concluded Russo-Japanese War (1904-5). The book ends with a section, Mulh'qat (Relevancies), which covers a seemingly random set of topics, including a hunting campaign in 1904 of Amir Habibullah Khan, nationalist activities in Greece, and the salaries of poets in Herat. This work clearly was written at different times and published by the author as single collection. Each chapter forms a unit, and there are no direct connections between them. The book contains lithographic images, including of the Qajar and Afghan rulers and of the author. World Digital Library."

          "Historical study of Iran during the Qajar dynasty in 19th century and of Afghanistan during the rules of Shīr ʻAlī Khān, ʻAbdurraḥmān K̲h̲ān̲ and Ḥabīb Allāh Khān.",
          "Kullīyāt-i Riyāz̤ī (Riyazi's book, usually known in English as the Collected Works of Ryazi) is a literary-historical work written in a mixture of prose and verse styles and published in a lithographic version in Mashhad, Iran, in 1906. It chronicles social, cultural, and political events taking place in the second-half of the 19th century in Afghanistan and Persia, especially during the reigns of Afghan ruler ʻAbd al-Rahman Khan (1880-1901) and his Persian counterpart, Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar (1896-1907). The author, Muhammad Yusuf Riyazi Haravi, was from a family of bureaucrats; his father had served different local Afghan officials in Herat. Historians generally have used colonial sources in their study of late-19th century Iran and Afghanistan; this book is a local historical source for the study of relations between these two countries and their formation. Muhammad Yusuf received support from Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar, who is praised as a just and learned ruler. The author also provides rich descriptions of his own family background, childhood education, travels, and his move to Qajar Iran and the confiscation of his and his family's property in Herat. The book includes a preface, table of contents, 12 chapters, and an extra section. The preface contains a 48-line verse and a prose section praising God, Muhammad, the family of ʻAli, the Qajar dynasts, and the author's own family. Chapter 1 describes the family background of the author. Chapter 2 contains several hikayat (stories) describing cities, political regions, and individuals; this chapter also includes a section on Afghanistan. Chapter 3, the longest, documents events in late-19th century Afghanistan and elsewhere, such as the signing of a friendship treaty between China and Japan, the death of a prime minister in the Ottoman Empire, and the Greek-Ottoman Wars. Chapter 4, called \"Book of Knowledge,\" discusses \"12 types of knowledge.\" Chapter 5, entitled \"Questions and Answers,\" describes ten encounters with different individuals in which various topics are discussed, for example, with a German traveler about religious laws in Islamic countries, and with an English officer about why Muslims do not send their children to Europe for schooling. Chapter 6 contains spiritual ghazal (lyric poems). Chapter 7, \"The Source of Crying,\" also has spiritual poems. Chapter 8 contains quintet poems, here called takhmisat. Chapter 9 is only one page and appears to be incomplete; it contains a few quintet and quatrain poems. Chapter 10, \"Book of Regrets,\" discusses 12 different topics, for example, the finite character of the world and the nature of worship. Chapter 11, \"Situations of Cities and Countries,\" is a brief ethnographic account of Beijing, Kabul, Mashhad, and other places. Chapter 12 offers a conclusion; it also describes the recently concluded Russo-Japanese War (1904-5). The book ends with a section, Mulh'qat (Relevancies), which covers a seemingly random set of topics, including a hunting campaign in 1904 of Amir Habibullah Khan, nationalist activities in Greece, and the salaries of poets in Herat. This work clearly was written at different times and published by the author as single collection. Each chapter forms a unit, and there are no direct connections between them. The book contains lithographic images, including of the Qajar and Afghan rulers and of the author. World Digital Library."

        "Tavarikh-i Khurshid-i Jahan (literally, Histories of the sun of the world) is primarily a history of Afghan Pushtun (or Pashtun) ancestry. It describes Afghan Pushtun genealogies, the various lineages, and the many political events, wars, and polities, such as the Safavid and Mughal dynasties in Khorasan and India, with which the Pushtuns have historically been identified. The book is arranged in four sections. Section one is a detailed list of contents. Section two begins with a preface containing the names of the author, patron, and contributor and proclaims that the work is \"to be a book of history of Afghan Pushtun ancestry since the creation of Adam.\" This section covers the various popular genealogical legends of the Afghan Pushtuns, chief among them that they are descendants of one of the tribes of Israelites, specifically children of Saul, the first king of Israel. Section three is the main text and has eight chapters devoted to the history of the Pushtuns. An epilogue, written both in prose and verse, gives the author's name, publication details, and a brief conclusion of the contents of the book. Tables charting the various genealogies of Afghan Pushtuns with detailed introductions to each lineage appear in several chapters. For example, tables outlining the descent of the Barakzais, Alokzais, Mohmands, Kakars, and other families appear on pages 188-319. These genealogical tables are followed by detailed discussions. The book was published in 1894 in Lahore (present-day Pakistan). The full name of the author, Sher Muḥammad Khān Saheb Gandapur Ibrahim Zai (circa 1837-1902), appears on the cover of the book. He most likely was a Gandapur Pushtun and an official appointed by the British in the municipality of Kulachi in Dera Ismail Khan, one of the administrative centers in the Northwest Frontier Province of British India. The preface says that he had written another historical work called Gulshan-i Afghanistan (Flower garden of Afghanistan), published under the title Hayat-i Afghani (Ancestry of the Afghans). Sher Muḥammad Khān claims that Hayat-i Afghani fell into the hands of Mohammad Hayat Khan Saheb, a judicial official in Bannu District of the province, who published it under his own name; the veracity of this claim has not been proven. It is clear, however, that Tavarīkh-i Khurshid-i Jahan was published under the patronage of Sardar Mohammad Hayat Khan Saheb, who could possibly have been the same official. The 319 pages of the work are numbered with Indo-Arabic numerals. World Digital Library."

          "Tavarikh-i Khurshid-i Jahan (literally, Histories of the sun of the world) is primarily a history of Afghan Pushtun (or Pashtun) ancestry. It describes Afghan Pushtun genealogies, the various lineages, and the many political events, wars, and polities, such as the Safavid and Mughal dynasties in Khorasan and India, with which the Pushtuns have historically been identified. The book is arranged in four sections. Section one is a detailed list of contents. Section two begins with a preface containing the names of the author, patron, and contributor and proclaims that the work is \"to be a book of history of Afghan Pushtun ancestry since the creation of Adam.\" This section covers the various popular genealogical legends of the Afghan Pushtuns, chief among them that they are descendants of one of the tribes of Israelites, specifically children of Saul, the first king of Israel. Section three is the main text and has eight chapters devoted to the history of the Pushtuns. An epilogue, written both in prose and verse, gives the author's name, publication details, and a brief conclusion of the contents of the book. Tables charting the various genealogies of Afghan Pushtuns with detailed introductions to each lineage appear in several chapters. For example, tables outlining the descent of the Barakzais, Alokzais, Mohmands, Kakars, and other families appear on pages 188-319. These genealogical tables are followed by detailed discussions. The book was published in 1894 in Lahore (present-day Pakistan). The full name of the author, Sher Muḥammad Khān Saheb Gandapur Ibrahim Zai (circa 1837-1902), appears on the cover of the book. He most likely was a Gandapur Pushtun and an official appointed by the British in the municipality of Kulachi in Dera Ismail Khan, one of the administrative centers in the Northwest Frontier Province of British India. The preface says that he had written another historical work called Gulshan-i Afghanistan (Flower garden of Afghanistan), published under the title Hayat-i Afghani (Ancestry of the Afghans). Sher Muḥammad Khān claims that Hayat-i Afghani fell into the hands of Mohammad Hayat Khan Saheb, a judicial official in Bannu District of the province, who published it under his own name; the veracity of this claim has not been proven. It is clear, however, that Tavarīkh-i Khurshid-i Jahan was published under the patronage of Sardar Mohammad Hayat Khan Saheb, who could possibly have been the same official. The 319 pages of the work are numbered with Indo-Arabic numerals. World Digital Library."
